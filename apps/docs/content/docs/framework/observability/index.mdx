ADK-TS provides built-in observability through OpenTelemetry integration. Monitor your agents' performance, trace execution flows, collect metrics, and gain insights into LLM interactions, tool usage, and agent behavior.

<Callout type="info" title="Built-in Support">
  All telemetry dependencies are included in `@iqai/adk`. No additional packages
  required.
</Callout>

## What You'll Learn

This section covers everything you need to know about observability in ADK-TS:

- **Setting up telemetry** - Initialize and configure the telemetry service
- **Distributed tracing** - Track agent invocations, tool executions, and LLM calls
- **Metrics collection** - Monitor performance with counters and histograms
- **Platform integrations** - Connect to Jaeger, Grafana, Datadog, and more
- **Production deployment** - Privacy controls, performance tuning, and best practices

## Key Features

| Feature                  | Description                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Distributed Tracing**  | Track agent invocations, tool executions, and LLM calls across your system                 |
| **Metrics Collection**   | Monitor performance with counters, histograms, and token usage tracking                    |
| **Auto-Instrumentation** | Optional automatic tracing of HTTP calls and database queries                              |
| **Privacy Controls**     | Configurable content capture for production environments                                   |
| **Platform Integration** | Works with Jaeger, Grafana, Datadog, New Relic, Honeycomb, and any OTLP-compatible backend |

## Quick Example

```typescript
import { telemetryService, AgentBuilder } from "@iqai/adk";

// Initialize telemetry before any agent operations
await telemetryService.initialize({
  appName: "my-agent-app",
  otlpEndpoint: "http://localhost:4318/v1/traces",
  appVersion: "1.0.0",
  enableMetrics: true,
  enableTracing: true,
});

// Your agents automatically send traces and metrics
const response = await AgentBuilder.withModel("gemini-2.5-flash").ask("Hello!");
console.log(response);

// Shutdown gracefully to flush pending telemetry
await telemetryService.shutdown(5000);
```
