Multi-Agent Systems enable you to build sophisticated applications by combining specialized agents, each with distinct capabilities and expertise. Rather than creating a single agent that handles everything, you compose multiple focused agents that work together—some for research, others for analysis, writing, or validation—creating powerful systems that can tackle complex problems no single agent could handle effectively.

ADK-TS provides a robust foundation for multi-agent systems through hierarchical agent organization, shared state management, and flexible communication patterns. You can build everything from simple sequential pipelines to complex, dynamic routing systems that adapt based on user needs.

<Callout type="info" title="When to Use Multi-Agent Systems">
  **Best for:** Complex workflows requiring multiple specializations, tasks
  needing different perspectives simultaneously, applications requiring clear
  separation of concerns, or systems where components need independent
  development and maintenance.
</Callout>

## Quick Start Example

Here's a content processing system that demonstrates the core multi-agent patterns:

```typescript
import {
  LlmAgent,
  SequentialAgent,
  ParallelAgent,
  AgentBuilder,
} from "@iqai/adk";

// Specialist agents for content analysis
const sentimentAnalyzer = new LlmAgent({
  name: "sentiment_analyzer",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  description: "Analyzes emotional tone and sentiment",
  instruction:
    "Analyze the sentiment and emotional tone of the content. Classify as positive, negative, or neutral with confidence scores.",
  outputKey: "sentiment_analysis",
});

const topicExtractor = new LlmAgent({
  name: "topic_extractor",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  description: "Identifies key topics and themes",
  instruction:
    "Extract the main topics, themes, and key concepts from the content. Provide a hierarchical list.",
  outputKey: "topic_analysis",
});

// Parallel analysis phase
const analysisPhase = new ParallelAgent({
  name: "content_analysis",
  description: "Perform multiple types of content analysis simultaneously",
  subAgents: [sentimentAnalyzer, topicExtractor],
});

// Content processor and formatter
const contentSummarizer = new LlmAgent({
  name: "content_summarizer",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  description: "Creates comprehensive summaries",
  instruction:
    "Based on sentiment analysis: {sentiment_analysis} and topic analysis: {topic_analysis}, create a comprehensive summary highlighting key insights.",
  outputKey: "content_summary",
});

// Complete processing pipeline
const contentProcessor = new SequentialAgent({
  name: "content_processing_system",
  description: "Analyze and summarize content using multiple perspectives",
  subAgents: [
    analysisPhase, // Parallel: sentiment + topic analysis
    contentSummarizer, // Sequential: combine insights into summary
  ],
});

// Usage with AgentBuilder
const { runner } = await AgentBuilder.withAgent(contentProcessor).build();

const result = await runner.ask(
  "Analyze this customer feedback: 'I love the new features, but the interface is confusing and slow.'"
);
```

### What Makes This Multi-Agent

This system demonstrates key multi-agent capabilities in ADK-TS:

- **⚡ Parallel Processing**: Sentiment and topic analysis happen simultaneously, reducing total processing time
- **🎯 Specialization**: Each agent has a focused responsibility—one analyzes emotions, another extracts topics
- **📊 State Flow**: Results flow between agents using `outputKey` and `{key}` state references
- **🔄 Orchestration**: `ParallelAgent` and `SequentialAgent` coordinate execution patterns
- **🧩 Modularity**: Each agent can be tested, modified, or replaced independently
- **🔗 Composability**: Workflow agents can be nested within other workflow agents

## Core Multi-Agent Concepts

ADK-TS provides foundational building blocks that enable sophisticated multi-agent system architectures. Understanding these concepts is essential for building effective multi-agent applications.

### Agent Hierarchy and Organization

Multi-agent systems in ADK-TS are organized as tree structures where agents have parent-child relationships through the `subAgents` parameter.

**Creating Hierarchy:** When you create an agent with `subAgents`, ADK-TS automatically establishes the parent-child relationships and sets the `parentAgent` property on each child.

**Single Parent Rule:** Each agent instance can only belong to one parent. This constraint ensures clear organizational boundaries and prevents circular dependencies or ambiguous ownership.

**Navigation Methods:** The hierarchy enables agent discovery using `agent.findAgent(name)` to locate any agent in the subtree, or `agent.parentAgent` to access the immediate parent. The `rootAgent` property provides access to the top-level agent.

**Transfer Scope:** The hierarchy defines which agents can transfer control to each other—agents can typically transfer to their parent, their sub-agents, and their siblings (peer agents under the same parent).

```typescript
// Establishing agent hierarchy
const billingAgent = new LlmAgent({
  name: "billing_specialist",
  description: "Handles billing and payment issues",
});

const coordinator = new LlmAgent({
  name: "support_coordinator",
  description: "Routes customer inquiries to specialists",
  subAgents: [billingAgent], // Creates parent-child relationship
});

// ADK-TS automatically sets: billingAgent.parentAgent === coordinator
// Navigate: coordinator.findAgent("billing_specialist") returns billingAgent
// Access root: billingAgent.rootAgent === coordinator
```

### Workflow Agents for Orchestration

ADK-TS provides specialized workflow agents that orchestrate the execution of other agents without performing tasks themselves. These agents control how and when their sub-agents execute, enabling complex coordination patterns.

**SequentialAgent** executes sub-agents one after another in the specified order.

- **Execution Flow:** Uses the same `InvocationContext` throughout, enabling seamless state sharing
- **State Persistence:** Each agent's output is preserved in session state for subsequent agents
- **Error Behavior:** Execution stops on the first error unless handled by callbacks
- **Use Cases:** Data processing pipelines, multi-step workflows, validation chains

```typescript
// Sequential pipeline example
const dataFetcher = new LlmAgent({
  name: "data_fetcher",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  instruction: "Retrieve the latest market data for analysis",
  outputKey: "raw_data", // Saved to session state
});

const dataAnalyzer = new LlmAgent({
  name: "data_analyzer",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  instruction: "Analyze the market data: {raw_data} and identify key trends", // State injection
  outputKey: "analysis_results",
});

const reportGenerator = new LlmAgent({
  name: "report_generator",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  instruction:
    "Generate a comprehensive report from analysis: {analysis_results}",
  outputKey: "final_report",
});

const marketPipeline = new SequentialAgent({
  name: "market_analysis_pipeline",
  description: "Complete market analysis workflow",
  subAgents: [dataFetcher, dataAnalyzer, reportGenerator],
});

// Execution: dataFetcher → dataAnalyzer → reportGenerator
// State flows: raw_data → analysis_results → final_report
```

**ParallelAgent** executes sub-agents simultaneously to improve performance and gather multiple perspectives.

- **Concurrent Execution:** All sub-agents run at the same time, reducing total execution time
- **Branch Isolation:** Each sub-agent gets a unique branch identifier (`ParentName.ChildName`) for isolated execution tracking
- **Shared State:** Despite branch isolation, all agents share the same session state for data exchange
- **Synchronization:** The ParallelAgent waits for all sub-agents to complete before continuing
- **Conflict Prevention:** Use distinct `outputKey` values to avoid state overwrites

```typescript
// Parallel processing example
const technicalAnalyzer = new LlmAgent({
  name: "technical_analyzer",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  instruction: "Perform technical analysis on the provided data",
  outputKey: "technical_analysis", // Unique key to avoid conflicts
});

const fundamentalAnalyzer = new LlmAgent({
  name: "fundamental_analyzer",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  instruction: "Perform fundamental analysis on the provided data",
  outputKey: "fundamental_analysis", // Different key
});

const sentimentAnalyzer = new LlmAgent({
  name: "sentiment_analyzer",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  instruction: "Analyze market sentiment from the provided data",
  outputKey: "sentiment_analysis", // Another unique key
});

const multiPerspectiveAnalysis = new ParallelAgent({
  name: "multi_perspective_analysis",
  description: "Analyze data from multiple perspectives simultaneously",
  subAgents: [technicalAnalyzer, fundamentalAnalyzer, sentimentAnalyzer],
});

// Execution: All three analyzers run concurrently
// Branch contexts: multi_perspective_analysis.technical_analyzer, etc.
// State populated with: technical_analysis, fundamental_analysis, sentiment_analysis
// Subsequent agents can access all results: "Combine insights from {technical_analysis}, {fundamental_analysis}, and {sentiment_analysis}"
```

**LoopAgent** executes sub-agents repeatedly until specific termination conditions are met.

- **Termination Control:** Stops when `maxIterations` is reached or any sub-agent escalates with `actions.escalate = true`
- **State Persistence:** Uses the same `InvocationContext` across iterations, allowing progressive refinement
- **Iteration Tracking:** State can be updated between iterations to control loop behavior
- **Use Cases:** Iterative improvement, quality assurance, retry logic, convergence-based workflows

```typescript
import { LoopAgent, LlmAgent, BaseAgent, Event, EventActions } from "@iqai/adk";
import { InvocationContext } from "@iqai/adk/types";

// Custom agent to control loop termination
class QualityChecker extends BaseAgent {
  constructor() {
    super({
      name: "quality_checker",
      description:
        "Evaluates quality and decides whether to continue iterating",
    });
  }

  protected async *runAsyncImpl(ctx: InvocationContext) {
    const qualityScore = ctx.session.state.get("quality_score", 0);
    const iteration = ctx.session.state.get("iteration_count", 0) + 1;

    // Update iteration counter
    ctx.session.state.set("iteration_count", iteration);

    // Stop if quality is sufficient (score >= 8) or too many attempts
    const shouldStop = qualityScore >= 8 || iteration >= 5;

    yield new Event({
      author: this.name,
      content: {
        parts: [
          {
            text: `Iteration ${iteration}: Quality score ${qualityScore}. ${
              shouldStop ? "Quality sufficient!" : "Needs improvement."
            }`,
          },
        ],
      },
      actions: new EventActions({ escalate: shouldStop }),
    });
  }
}

const contentImprover = new LlmAgent({
  name: "content_improver",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  instruction:
    "Improve the content quality. Rate the current quality from 1-10 and provide an improved version.",
  outputKey: "quality_score", // Will be used by QualityChecker
});

const iterativeImprovement = new LoopAgent({
  name: "iterative_improvement",
  description: "Iteratively improve content until quality standards are met",
  maxIterations: 10, // Safety limit
  subAgents: [contentImprover, new QualityChecker()],
});

// Execution: contentImprover → QualityChecker → repeat until escalation
// Loop continues until quality_score >= 8 or maxIterations reached
```

### Communication Patterns

ADK-TS provides several mechanisms for agents to exchange data and coordinate their actions. Understanding these patterns is crucial for building effective multi-agent systems.

#### Shared Session State

The primary communication mechanism in ADK-TS is through shared session state, enabling data flow between agents in the same execution context.

**State Storage:** Agents write data to session state using the `outputKey` property, which automatically saves the agent's response to the specified key.

**State Access:** Use `{keyName}` syntax in agent instructions to reference state values. ADK-TS automatically injects the actual values before sending instructions to the LLM.

**State Lifecycle:** State persists throughout the entire agent execution chain, allowing data to flow from one agent to the next.

**Best Practices:**

- Use descriptive, unique keys: `user_preferences`, `analysis_results`, `validation_status`
- Ensure keys don't conflict, especially in parallel execution
- Document state contracts between agents
- Validate state presence before consuming

```typescript
// Producer agent - writes to state
const dataCollector = new LlmAgent({
  name: "data_collector",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  instruction:
    "Collect user preferences and demographic information from the input",
  outputKey: "user_profile", // Saves response to state["user_profile"]
});

// Consumer agent - reads from state
const recommendationEngine = new LlmAgent({
  name: "recommendation_engine",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  instruction:
    "Based on the user profile: {user_profile}, generate personalized recommendations", // {user_profile} gets replaced with actual data
});

const pipeline = new SequentialAgent({
  name: "personalization_pipeline",
  description: "Collect preferences and generate recommendations",
  subAgents: [dataCollector, recommendationEngine],
});

// Flow: dataCollector saves to state → recommendationEngine reads from state
```

#### Agent Transfer (Dynamic Routing)

ADK-TS enables intelligent, LLM-driven routing where agents can dynamically transfer control to other agents based on the context and user needs.

**How It Works:** When an agent has sub-agents, ADK-TS automatically enables `AutoFlow`, which provides a `transfer_to_agent()` function. The LLM can call this function to transfer control to an appropriate specialist agent.

**Transfer Scope:** Agents can transfer to:

- Their sub-agents (delegation down the hierarchy)
- Their parent agent (escalation up the hierarchy)
- Their sibling agents (peer-to-peer routing, if `disallowTransferToPeers` is false)

**AutoFlow Requirements:** The agent must have sub-agents to enable transfer capabilities. Clear agent descriptions help the LLM make better routing decisions.

**Configuration:** Use `disallowTransferToParent` and `disallowTransferToPeers` to restrict transfer directions if needed.

```typescript
// Specialist agents with clear descriptions
const billingAgent = new LlmAgent({
  name: "billing_specialist",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  description:
    "Handles billing issues, payment problems, refunds, and subscription management",
});

const technicalAgent = new LlmAgent({
  name: "technical_specialist",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  description:
    "Resolves technical issues, bugs, system problems, and integration questions",
});

// Coordinator with clear transfer instructions
const supportCoordinator = new LlmAgent({
  name: "support_coordinator",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  description: "Routes customer support requests to appropriate specialists",
  instruction: `You coordinate customer support. Analyze the user's issue and transfer to the appropriate specialist:

- For billing, payment, subscription, or refund issues → transfer to 'billing_specialist'
- For technical problems, bugs, or system issues → transfer to 'technical_specialist'  
- For general questions, handle them yourself

Use the transfer_to_agent function when you identify a specialist who can better help.`,
  subAgents: [billingAgent, technicalAgent], // Enables AutoFlow
});

// Usage examples:
// "I was charged twice this month" → transfers to billing_specialist
// "The app keeps crashing" → transfers to technical_specialist
// "What are your business hours?" → handles directly (no transfer)
```

#### Agent Tools (Explicit Invocation)

`AgentTool` allows you to wrap any agent as a callable tool, enabling explicit, controlled invocation with clear contracts.

**How It Works:** Wrap an agent with `AgentTool` and add it to another agent's `tools` list. The LLM can then invoke the wrapped agent like any other tool, receiving its output as a tool result.

**Execution Model:** When invoked, `AgentTool` creates a child invocation context, runs the wrapped agent, captures the response, and returns it to the calling agent. State changes from the wrapped agent are preserved.

**Advantages:**

- Explicit control over agent invocation
- Clear, deterministic tool contracts
- Composable agent architectures
- Results flow directly back to the caller

**When to Use:** Choose `AgentTool` when you need predictable, explicit agent invocation rather than dynamic routing.

```typescript
import { AgentTool, LlmAgent } from "@iqai/adk";

// Specialized capability agents
const dataValidator = new LlmAgent({
  name: "data_validator",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  description: "Validates data quality and format",
  instruction:
    "Analyze the provided data for completeness, accuracy, and format issues. Return validation results.",
});

const insightExtractor = new LlmAgent({
  name: "insight_extractor",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  description: "Extracts key insights and patterns from data",
  instruction:
    "Analyze the data and extract the most important insights, trends, and patterns.",
});

// Orchestrating agent that uses other agents as tools
const dataAnalyst = new LlmAgent({
  name: "data_analyst",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  description:
    "Comprehensive data analysis using validation and insight extraction",
  instruction: `You are a data analyst. For any data analysis request:
    1. First use the validate_data tool to check data quality
    2. Then use the extract_insights tool to find patterns
    3. Combine the results into a comprehensive analysis report`,
  tools: [
    new AgentTool({
      name: "validate_data",
      agent: dataValidator,
      description: "Validate data quality and format",
    }),
    new AgentTool({
      name: "extract_insights",
      agent: insightExtractor,
      description: "Extract key insights from data",
    }),
  ],
});

// Usage: dataAnalyst can call validate_data and extract_insights as needed
// Each tool invocation runs the wrapped agent and returns results
```

## Common Multi-Agent Patterns

### Coordinator/Dispatcher Pattern

A central agent intelligently routes requests to specialized agents based on request analysis and agent capabilities.

**Structure:** Main coordinator agent with specialist sub-agents

**Communication:** LLM-driven agent transfer using AutoFlow

**Best for:** Customer service systems, help desks, domain-specific routing, request classification

**Key Characteristics:**

- Single entry point for all user requests
- Dynamic routing based on content analysis
- Specialists focus on their domain expertise
- Coordinator handles routing logic and fallback cases

```typescript
// Specialist agents with clear, distinct descriptions
const billingSpecialist = new LlmAgent({
  name: "billing_specialist",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  description:
    "Handles billing issues, payment problems, refunds, and subscription management",
  instruction:
    "You are a billing specialist. Help customers with payment issues, billing questions, refunds, and subscription management.",
});

const technicalSpecialist = new LlmAgent({
  name: "technical_specialist",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  description:
    "Resolves technical problems, system issues, bugs, and integration questions",
  instruction:
    "You are a technical support specialist. Help customers resolve technical issues, system problems, and integration questions.",
});

const generalSupport = new LlmAgent({
  name: "general_support",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  description:
    "Provides general information, account questions, and product assistance",
  instruction:
    "You provide general customer support for account questions, product information, and general assistance.",
});

// Coordinator with clear routing logic
const customerServiceRouter = new LlmAgent({
  name: "customer_service_router",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  description: "Routes customer inquiries to appropriate specialists",
  instruction: `You are a customer service coordinator. Analyze customer requests and route them to the appropriate specialist:

- For billing, payments, refunds, or subscription issues → transfer_to_agent('billing_specialist')  
- For technical problems, bugs, system issues, or integrations → transfer_to_agent('technical_specialist')
- For general questions, account info, or product features → transfer_to_agent('general_support')

If the request doesn't clearly fit a category, handle it yourself or ask for clarification.`,
  subAgents: [billingSpecialist, technicalSpecialist, generalSupport],
});

// Usage examples:
// "I was double-charged this month" → routes to billing_specialist
// "The app keeps crashing" → routes to technical_specialist
// "How do I change my password?" → routes to general_support
```

### Sequential Pipeline Pattern

Multi-step workflows where agents execute in a specific order, with each agent building on the previous agent's output.

**Structure:** `SequentialAgent` orchestrating specialized sub-agents

**Communication:** Shared session state using `outputKey` and `{key}` references

**Best for:** Data processing pipelines, content creation workflows, multi-stage analysis, validation chains

**Key Characteristics:**

- Deterministic execution order
- Each agent receives output from previous agents
- State accumulates throughout the pipeline
- Failure at any step can halt the entire process

```typescript
// Content creation pipeline example
const contentResearcher = new LlmAgent({
  name: "content_researcher",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  instruction:
    "Research the given topic thoroughly. Gather key facts, statistics, and relevant information.",
  outputKey: "research_data", // Output saved to session state
});

const contentOutliner = new LlmAgent({
  name: "content_outliner",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  instruction:
    "Based on the research data: {research_data}, create a detailed content outline with main points and structure.", // References research_data from state
  outputKey: "content_outline",
});

const contentWriter = new LlmAgent({
  name: "content_writer",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  instruction:
    "Using the research: {research_data} and outline: {content_outline}, write a comprehensive, well-structured article.", // References both previous outputs
  outputKey: "draft_content",
});

const contentEditor = new LlmAgent({
  name: "content_editor",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  instruction:
    "Review and edit the draft content: {draft_content}. Improve clarity, flow, and accuracy.",
  outputKey: "final_content",
});

// Sequential pipeline orchestration
const contentCreationPipeline = new SequentialAgent({
  name: "content_creation_pipeline",
  description: "Complete content creation from research to final edited piece",
  subAgents: [contentResearcher, contentOutliner, contentWriter, contentEditor],
});

// Execution flow:
// 1. contentResearcher → state["research_data"]
// 2. contentOutliner → reads research_data → state["content_outline"]
// 3. contentWriter → reads research_data + content_outline → state["draft_content"]
// 4. contentEditor → reads draft_content → state["final_content"]
```

### Parallel Processing Pattern

Execute independent tasks simultaneously to improve performance, then combine results into a comprehensive analysis.

**Structure:** `ParallelAgent` for concurrent execution, optionally followed by a synthesis agent

**Communication:** Each parallel agent writes to distinct state keys, synthesis agent reads all keys

**Best for:** Multi-perspective analysis, concurrent data gathering, independent processing tasks, performance optimization

**Key Characteristics:**

- Multiple agents execute simultaneously
- Significant performance improvement (time = longest task + synthesis)
- Each agent uses unique `outputKey` to avoid conflicts
- Results can be combined by subsequent agents

```typescript
// Multi-perspective analysis example
const sentimentAnalyzer = new LlmAgent({
  name: "sentiment_analyzer",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  instruction:
    "Analyze the sentiment and emotional tone of the provided content. Classify sentiment and provide confidence scores.",
  outputKey: "sentiment_analysis", // Unique key for this perspective
});

const topicExtractor = new LlmAgent({
  name: "topic_extractor",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  instruction:
    "Extract and categorize the main topics, themes, and subjects discussed in the content.",
  outputKey: "topic_extraction", // Different key to avoid conflicts
});

const styleAnalyzer = new LlmAgent({
  name: "style_analyzer",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  instruction:
    "Analyze the writing style, tone, complexity, and target audience of the content.",
  outputKey: "style_analysis", // Another unique key
});

// Parallel execution of all analysis types
const multiPerspectiveAnalysis = new ParallelAgent({
  name: "multi_perspective_analysis",
  description: "Analyze content from multiple perspectives simultaneously",
  subAgents: [sentimentAnalyzer, topicExtractor, styleAnalyzer],
});

// Optional: Synthesis agent to combine results
const insightSynthesizer = new LlmAgent({
  name: "insight_synthesizer",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  instruction: `Synthesize insights from multiple analyses:
    - Sentiment: {sentiment_analysis}
    - Topics: {topic_extraction}  
    - Style: {style_analysis}
    
    Create a comprehensive analysis that identifies patterns, correlations, and key insights across all perspectives.`,
  outputKey: "comprehensive_analysis",
});

// Complete workflow: parallel analysis + synthesis
const comprehensiveContentAnalysis = new SequentialAgent({
  name: "comprehensive_content_analysis",
  description: "Multi-perspective analysis with synthesis",
  subAgents: [multiPerspectiveAnalysis, insightSynthesizer],
});

// Execution:
// Phase 1 (Parallel): All three analyzers run simultaneously
//   - sentiment_analyzer → state["sentiment_analysis"]
//   - topic_extractor → state["topic_extraction"]
//   - style_analyzer → state["style_analysis"]
// Phase 2 (Sequential): insightSynthesizer combines all results
```

### Hierarchical Composition Pattern

Build complex capabilities by composing specialized agents into reusable tools, creating multiple levels of abstraction.

**Structure:** Multi-level agent hierarchy using `AgentTool` for explicit composition

**Communication:** Tool-based invocation with clear input/output contracts

**Best for:** Complex workflows, reusable capabilities, modular system design, building agent libraries

**Key Characteristics:**

- Agents are composed into higher-level capabilities
- Lower-level agents can be reused across different contexts
- Clear, explicit invocation contracts at each level
- Results flow back through the hierarchy

```typescript
import { AgentTool } from "@iqai/adk";

// Foundation layer: Basic capabilities
const textAnalyzer = new LlmAgent({
  name: "text_analyzer",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  description: "Analyzes text for sentiment, topics, and key information",
  instruction:
    "Analyze the provided text and extract key information, sentiment, and main topics.",
});

const dataSummarizer = new LlmAgent({
  name: "data_summarizer",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  description: "Summarizes complex information into concise insights",
  instruction:
    "Create a clear, concise summary of the provided information, highlighting the most important points.",
});

// Intermediate layer: Composed capabilities
const contentProcessor = new LlmAgent({
  name: "content_processor",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  description: "Processes content through analysis and summarization",
  instruction: `Process content through multiple stages:
    1. Use text_analysis to understand the content structure
    2. Use summarization to create key insights
    3. Combine results into a processed content report`,
  tools: [
    new AgentTool({
      name: "text_analysis",
      agent: textAnalyzer,
      description: "Analyze text for structure and content",
    }),
    new AgentTool({
      name: "summarization",
      agent: dataSummarizer,
      description: "Summarize information into key points",
    }),
  ],
});

const qualityAssessor = new LlmAgent({
  name: "quality_assessor",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  description: "Assesses content quality and provides improvement suggestions",
  instruction:
    "Evaluate content quality on clarity, accuracy, completeness, and provide specific improvement suggestions.",
});

// Top layer: High-level orchestration
const contentManager = new LlmAgent({
  name: "content_manager",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  description: "Manages end-to-end content processing and quality assurance",
  instruction: `Manage complete content workflow:
    1. Use process_content to analyze and summarize
    2. Use assess_quality to evaluate results
    3. Provide final recommendations and processed content`,
  tools: [
    new AgentTool({
      name: "process_content",
      agent: contentProcessor,
      description: "Process content through analysis and summarization",
    }),
    new AgentTool({
      name: "assess_quality",
      agent: qualityAssessor,
      description: "Assess content quality and suggest improvements",
    }),
  ],
});

// Usage: contentManager orchestrates the entire hierarchy
// contentManager → contentProcessor → textAnalyzer + dataSummarizer
// contentManager → qualityAssessor
// Results flow back up through the tool calls
```

### Review/Critique Pattern

Improve output quality through structured generation and review cycles, ensuring high-quality results through peer review.

**Structure:** Sequential workflow with generator, critic, and optional refiner agents

**Communication:** Shared session state for draft content and feedback exchange

**Best for:** Content quality assurance, code review processes, creative writing improvement, fact-checking workflows

**Key Characteristics:**

- Generator creates initial output
- Critic evaluates against quality criteria
- Refiner incorporates feedback improvements
- Can be repeated in loops for iterative refinement

```typescript
// Generator-Critic workflow for content creation
const contentGenerator = new LlmAgent({
  name: "content_generator",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  instruction:
    "Create comprehensive content based on the provided requirements. Focus on accuracy, clarity, and completeness.",
  outputKey: "initial_content", // Saves generated content
});

const contentCritic = new LlmAgent({
  name: "content_critic",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  instruction: `Review the content: {initial_content}
    
    Evaluate on these criteria:
    - Accuracy: Are facts and information correct?
    - Clarity: Is the content easy to understand?
    - Completeness: Does it cover all necessary points?
    - Structure: Is it well-organized and logical?
    
    Provide specific, actionable feedback with examples of what needs improvement.`,
  outputKey: "review_feedback", // Saves critic's feedback
});

const contentRefiner = new LlmAgent({
  name: "content_refiner",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  instruction: `Improve the original content: {initial_content} based on this feedback: {review_feedback}
    
    Make specific improvements while maintaining the original intent and style. Address each point of feedback systematically.`,
  outputKey: "refined_content", // Saves improved version
});

// Sequential workflow: Generate → Critique → Refine
const qualityContentWorkflow = new SequentialAgent({
  name: "quality_content_workflow",
  description: "Generate high-quality content through review and refinement",
  subAgents: [contentGenerator, contentCritic, contentRefiner],
});

// Optional: Iterative version using LoopAgent
const iterativeQualityWorkflow = new LoopAgent({
  name: "iterative_quality_workflow",
  description: "Repeatedly refine content until quality standards are met",
  maxIterations: 3,
  subAgents: [contentGenerator, contentCritic, contentRefiner],
});

// Execution flow:
// 1. contentGenerator → state["initial_content"]
// 2. contentCritic → reads initial_content → state["review_feedback"]
// 3. contentRefiner → reads both → state["refined_content"]
```

### Iterative Refinement Pattern

Continuously improve results through repeated cycles until quality criteria are met or maximum iterations are reached.

**Structure:** `LoopAgent` orchestrating improvement and evaluation agents

**Communication:** Persistent state evolution with escalation-based termination

**Best for:** Quality improvement workflows, optimization tasks, progressive enhancement, problem-solving processes

**Key Characteristics:**

- State persists and improves across iterations
- Termination based on quality gates or iteration limits
- Progressive refinement with each cycle
- Built-in safety mechanisms to prevent infinite loops

```typescript
import { LoopAgent, LlmAgent, BaseAgent, Event, EventActions } from "@iqai/adk";

// Agent that performs improvements
const solutionImprover = new LlmAgent({
  name: "solution_improver",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  instruction: `Analyze the current solution: {current_solution} and the original problem: {problem_statement}
    
    Identify specific areas for improvement:
    - Completeness: Does it fully address the problem?
    - Efficiency: Can it be optimized?
    - Clarity: Is it well-explained?
    - Accuracy: Are there any errors?
    
    Provide an improved version that addresses these issues.`,
  outputKey: "current_solution", // Updates solution each iteration
});

// Agent that evaluates quality
const qualityEvaluator = new LlmAgent({
  name: "quality_evaluator",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  instruction: `Evaluate the solution: {current_solution} against the problem: {problem_statement}
    
    Rate on a scale of 1-10 considering:
    - Completeness (fully addresses problem)
    - Accuracy (correct and reliable)
    - Clarity (well-explained)
    - Efficiency (optimal approach)
    
    Provide only the numeric score (1-10).`,
  outputKey: "quality_score", // Saves evaluation score
});

// Custom termination agent
class QualityGate extends BaseAgent {
  constructor() {
    super({
      name: "quality_gate",
      description: "Determines when quality standards are met",
    });
  }

  protected async *runAsyncImpl(ctx: InvocationContext) {
    const score = parseInt(ctx.session.state.get("quality_score", "0"));
    const iteration = ctx.session.state.get("iteration_count", 0) + 1;

    // Track iterations
    ctx.session.state.set("iteration_count", iteration);

    // Stop if quality is high enough (score >= 8)
    const qualityMet = score >= 8;

    yield new Event({
      author: this.name,
      content: {
        parts: [
          {
            text: `Iteration ${iteration}: Quality score ${score}/10. ${
              qualityMet
                ? "Quality target achieved!"
                : "Continuing refinement..."
            }`,
          },
        ],
      },
      actions: new EventActions({ escalate: qualityMet }),
    });
  }
}

// Iterative refinement workflow
const iterativeImprovement = new LoopAgent({
  name: "iterative_improvement",
  description: "Iteratively improve solution until quality standards are met",
  maxIterations: 5, // Prevent infinite loops
  subAgents: [solutionImprover, qualityEvaluator, new QualityGate()],
});

// Usage with AgentBuilder
const { runner } = await AgentBuilder.withAgent(iterativeImprovement).build();

// Execution pattern:
// Iteration 1: solutionImprover → qualityEvaluator → qualityGate (continue if score < 8)
// Iteration 2: solutionImprover → qualityEvaluator → qualityGate (continue if score < 8)
// ... continues until quality_score >= 8 or maxIterations reached
```

### Human-in-the-Loop Pattern

Integrate human oversight and decision-making into automated workflows using custom tools for external system integration.

**Structure:** Agents with custom tools that interface with external approval systems

**Communication:** Tool-based integration with human interfaces (Slack, email, web UI)

**Best for:** Compliance workflows, quality gates, creative approval processes, high-stakes decision points

**Key Characteristics:**

- Workflow pauses at critical decision points
- Human input is captured and logged
- Integration with external systems (ticketing, messaging, custom UI)
- Audit trail for compliance and transparency

```typescript
import { createTool, LlmAgent, SequentialAgent } from "@iqai/adk";
import { z } from "zod";

// Custom tool for human approval integration
const humanApprovalTool = createTool({
  name: "request_human_approval",
  description: "Request human approval for important decisions",
  schema: z.object({
    decision: z.string().describe("The decision requiring approval"),
    reasoning: z.string().describe("Why this decision is being made"),
    urgency: z.enum(["low", "medium", "high"]).describe("Priority level"),
  }),
  fn: async ({ decision, reasoning, urgency }) => {
    // This would integrate with your approval system
    // Examples: Slack bot, email notification, web dashboard

    console.log(`🔔 Human approval requested:`);
    console.log(`Decision: ${decision}`);
    console.log(`Reasoning: ${reasoning}`);
    console.log(`Urgency: ${urgency}`);

    // Simulate human approval (in production, this would wait for real input)
    const approved = Math.random() > 0.3; // 70% approval rate for demo

    return {
      approved,
      approver: "human.reviewer@company.com",
      feedback: approved ? "Looks good to proceed" : "Needs more analysis",
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    };
  },
});

// Workflow with human approval checkpoint
const proposalAnalyzer = new LlmAgent({
  name: "proposal_analyzer",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  instruction:
    "Analyze the proposal for risks, benefits, and feasibility. Provide a comprehensive assessment.",
  outputKey: "analysis_report",
});

const approvalGate = new LlmAgent({
  name: "approval_gate",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  instruction: `Based on the analysis: {analysis_report}, request human approval for proceeding.
    
    Use the request_human_approval tool with:
    - Clear description of what needs approval
    - Summary of key findings and reasoning
    - Appropriate urgency level`,
  tools: [humanApprovalTool],
  outputKey: "approval_decision",
});

const actionExecutor = new LlmAgent({
  name: "action_executor",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  instruction: `Check the approval decision: {approval_decision}
    
    If approved: Proceed with implementation and log the action
    If rejected: Document the rejection and suggest next steps`,
  outputKey: "execution_result",
});

// Complete human-in-the-loop workflow
const approvalWorkflow = new SequentialAgent({
  name: "approval_workflow",
  description: "Automated workflow with human approval checkpoints",
  subAgents: [proposalAnalyzer, approvalGate, actionExecutor],
});

// Execution flow:
// 1. proposalAnalyzer → creates analysis_report
// 2. approvalGate → requests human approval (workflow pauses)
// 3. Human reviews and responds via external system
// 4. actionExecutor → proceeds based on approval decision
```

## Best Practices

### Design Principles

**Single Responsibility:** Design each agent with a focused, specific purpose. A billing agent should handle payment issues, while a technical agent resolves system problems. This focused approach makes agents easier to test, debug, and reuse across different workflows.

**Clear State Contracts:** Use descriptive, unique state keys (`user_preferences`, `analysis_results`, `validation_status`) and document what data flows between agents. This prevents conflicts and makes debugging much easier.

**Descriptive Agent Names:** Use clear, searchable names for agents (`billing_specialist`, `technical_support`) that make hierarchy navigation and transfer routing more reliable.

**Shallow Hierarchies:** Keep agent hierarchies relatively flat (2-3 levels) to reduce complexity and improve maintainability.

### Communication Patterns

**State Key Management:** In parallel workflows, use distinct `outputKey` values to prevent conflicts. Document state dependencies between agents to make data flow clear.

**Transfer Instructions:** For agent transfer patterns, write specific routing rules with clear examples. Use non-overlapping agent descriptions to help the LLM make accurate routing decisions.

**Tool vs Transfer:** Use `AgentTool` when you need explicit control and predictable results. Use agent transfer when you want dynamic, context-aware routing.

### Production Considerations

**Error Handling:** Design fallback strategies for failed agents. In sequential workflows, decide whether errors should halt execution or trigger alternative paths.

**Performance Optimization:** Use `ParallelAgent` to reduce latency when tasks are independent. Monitor resource usage and set reasonable concurrency limits.

**Monitoring:** Implement logging for state transitions, routing decisions, and performance metrics. This is crucial for debugging complex multi-agent interactions.

### Development Tips

**Start Simple:** Begin with sequential workflows before moving to parallel or loop patterns. Add complexity gradually as you understand the interactions.

**Test Isolation:** Test individual agents independently before testing the complete workflow. Mock external dependencies and sub-agents during unit testing.

**State Debugging:** Use clear state key names and log state transitions to make debugging easier when agents don't receive expected data.

**Agent Builder Usage:** Leverage `AgentBuilder` for rapid prototyping and testing. It provides a clean API for creating and experimenting with multi-agent patterns.
