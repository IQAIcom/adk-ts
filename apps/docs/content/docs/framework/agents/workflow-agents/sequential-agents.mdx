Sequential agents execute sub-agents one after another in a predetermined order, creating predictable pipeline workflows where each step builds on the previous one.

## Quick Example

Here's how to create a research pipeline that processes information through multiple sequential steps:

```typescript
// Create specialized agents for each step
const { agent: researchAgent } = await AgentBuilder
  .create("researcher")
  .withModel("gemini-2.5-flash")
  .withTools(new GoogleSearchTool(), new WikipediaTool())
  .withInstruction("Gather comprehensive information about the topic")
  .build();

const { agent: analysisAgent } = await AgentBuilder
  .create("analyst")
  .withModel("gemini-2.5-flash")
  .withInstruction("Analyze the research data and identify key insights")
  .build();

const { agent: summaryAgent } = await AgentBuilder
  .create("summarizer")
  .withModel("gemini-2.5-flash")
  .withInstruction("Create a concise summary with actionable recommendations")
  .build();

// Create sequential pipeline that runs research → analysis → summary
const { runner } = await AgentBuilder
  .create("research-pipeline")
  .withDescription("Comprehensive research pipeline with analysis and summary")
  .asSequential([researchAgent, analysisAgent, summaryAgent])
  .build();

// Each agent processes the output from the previous one
const result = await runner.ask("Analyze the current state of renewable energy adoption");
```

## Key Benefits

- **Ordered Processing**: Each step builds on the previous agent's output
- **Predictable Flow**: Deterministic execution order for reliable workflows
- **Context Continuity**: Information flows naturally through the conversation
- **Specialized Roles**: Each agent can focus on its specific expertise

## When to Use

<Callout type="info" title="Order Matters">
Use sequential agents when the order of execution is important and each step depends on the previous ones.
</Callout>

**Ideal for:**
- Multi-step pipelines (research → analysis → summary)
- Data processing workflows (extract → transform → load)
- Content creation (draft → review → finalize)
- Quality assurance (generate → validate → approve)

**Avoid when:**
- Tasks are independent and can run simultaneously
- Order doesn't matter for the final result
- You need faster parallel processing
