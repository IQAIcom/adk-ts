Railway is a cloud platform that simplifies deploying containerized applications with built-in CI/CD and automatic scaling. **Best for**: Quick deployments, containerized applications, and managed infrastructure. Railway offers simple setup and automatic scaling, though pricing may be higher for large-scale deployments. This guide shows you how to deploy your ADK-TS agent to Railway using a Docker image.

## Prerequisites

- **[Railway Account](https://railway.app)**: Sign up for free
- **ADK-TS Project**: Your agent code ready for deployment
- **[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)**: Installed and configured (Optional for GitHub integration)
- **[Docker Hub Account](https://hub.docker.com/)**: For hosting your Docker images (Optional for GitHub integration)

## Deployment Options

Railway offers three deployment methods:

1. **Simple GitHub Integration**: Railway automatically detects and builds your project from GitHub, no Docker required.
2. **Dockerfile via GitHub**: Use a Dockerfile in your repo for custom builds
3. **Docker Hub Image**: Build and push your Docker image to Docker Hub, then deploy it on Railway

## Option 1: GitHub Auto-Deploy (No Docker Required)

Railway uses [Railpack](https://railpack.com/) to automatically detect and build your Node.js/TypeScript project without requiring Docker knowledge. **Recommended for beginners.**

### Step 1: Push to GitHub

Commit and push your code to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Railway deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Connect to Railway

1. Log in to Railway
2. Click **"New Project"**
3. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. Authorize Railway to access your GitHub account (if first time)
5. Choose your ADK-TS repository from the list
6. Railway automatically detects it's a Node.js project and starts building

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

See [Configuring Environment Variables](#configuring-environment-variables) below for detailed instructions.

### Step 4: Automatic Deployment

Railway handles everything automatically:

- First deployment: Clones your repo, installs dependencies, builds, and deploys
- Future updates: Every time you push to your connected branch, Railway rebuilds and redeploys
- No manual steps needed after initial setup

## Option 2: Custom Dockerfile via GitHub

Use a custom Dockerfile when you need more control over the build process or require system-level dependencies.

### Step 1: Create Dockerfile and Push to GitHub

Create a `Dockerfile` in your project root. See the [Docker deployment guide](/docs/framework/guides/deployment/docker#step-1-create-dockerfile) for a complete Dockerfile example.

Commit and push the Dockerfile to GitHub:

```bash
git add Dockerfile
git commit -m "Add Dockerfile for Railway deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Connect to Railway

1. Log in to Railway
2. Click **"New Project"**
3. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. Authorize Railway to access your GitHub account (if first time)
5. Choose your ADK-TS repository from the list
6. Railway will detect the Dockerfile and use it for building

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

See [Configuring Environment Variables](#configuring-environment-variables) below.

### Step 4: Automatic Deployment

Railway now handles everything automatically:

- First deployment: Detects your `Dockerfile`, builds the image, and deploys
- Future updates: Every time you push to your connected branch, Railway rebuilds and redeploys
- No manual steps needed after initial setup

## Option 3: Pre-Built Docker Image from Docker Hub

Build your Docker image locally and deploy it to Railway from Docker Hub for maximum control over the build process.

### Step 1: Build and Push Docker Image

First, create a `Dockerfile` in your project root. See the [Docker deployment guide](/docs/framework/guides/deployment/docker#step-1-create-dockerfile) for a complete Dockerfile example.

**Build for Railway:**

Railway uses AMD64 processors, so build specifically for that platform:

```bash
# Build for Railway (AMD64 platform)
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t your_docker_username/your_agent_name:tag .
```

Replace `your_docker_username` with your Docker Hub username, `your_agent_name` with your project name, and `tag` with a version (like `v1.0` or `latest`).

**Push to Docker Hub:**


```bash
# Login to Docker Hub
docker login

# Push the image
docker push your_docker_username/your_agent_name:tag
```

### Step 2: Connect to Railway


1. Log in to Railway
2. Click **"New Project"** in the top right
3. Select **"Deploy from Docker Image"** from the options
4. Enter your full image name exactly as you pushed it: `your_docker_username/your_agent_name:tag`
5. Railway will pull your image from Docker Hub

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

See [Configuring Environment Variables](#configuring-environment-variables) below.

### Step 4: Deploy

Click **"Deploy"** and Railway will start your container using the pulled image.

## Configuring Environment Variables

All three deployment options require environment variables to be configured in Railway. This is a one-time setup for each project.

### Add Environment Variables to Railway

1. In your Railway project dashboard, click the **"Variables"** tab
2. Click **"New Variable"** to add each required environment variable
3. Add your configuration based on your agent's needs:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_API_KEY` (depending on your LLM provider)
   - `LLM_MODEL` (e.g., `gpt-4`, `gemini-2.5-flash`)
   - Bot tokens (`DISCORD_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, etc.)
   - Any other custom variables your agent requires

<Callout type="info" title="Environment Variables Are Encrypted">
  Railway automatically encrypts all environment variables. Never commit these
  values to your git repository.
</Callout>


## Verifying Deployment

### Check Deployment Status

In your Railway project dashboard:

1. Look for the **"Deployments"** section - it should show "Active" with a green indicator
2. Click on the latest deployment to view detailed logs
3. Check the logs for your agent's startup messages
4. Look for any error messages (shown in red)

### Test Your Agent

Once deployment is active, test that it works:

- **Discord bots**: Send a command in your Discord server
- **Telegram bots**: Message your bot
- **API agents**: Make a test HTTP request to your endpoint
- **Check logs**: Watch Railway logs in real-time to see your agent responding

## Monitoring and Updates

### View Logs

Railway provides real-time logs in the **"Logs"** tab of your deployment. Use them to:

- Debug issues by viewing error messages
- Monitor your agent's activity and responses
- Track warnings or performance issues

### Updating Your Deployment

**For GitHub deployments (Options 1 & 2):**

1. Make code changes locally
2. Test changes locally
3. Commit and push to your connected branch:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update agent features"
   git push origin main
   ```
4. Railway automatically detects changes, rebuilds, and redeploys
5. Watch the deployment logs to confirm success

**For Docker Hub deployments (Option 3):**

1. Make code changes locally
2. Build and push new Docker image with a new tag (e.g., `v1.1`)
3. In Railway dashboard, update the image reference to the new tag
4. Railway pulls the new image and redeploys automatically

## Railway Troubleshooting

### Docker Push Fails

**Problem**: Can't push image to Docker Hub

- Verify you're logged in (run `docker login`)
- Check your image name format matches `username/image:tag`
- Confirm you have permission to push to this repository
- Check your internet connection

### Missing Environment Variables

**Problem**: Agent crashes or features don't work

- Go to Railway's **"Variables"** tab and verify all variables are present
- Check that variable names match exactly what your code expects (case-sensitive)
- Look for typos in variable values
- Restart the deployment after adding missing variables

### Build Failures

**Problem**: Railway build fails

- Click on the failed deployment to view detailed build logs
- Look for error messages about missing dependencies or syntax errors
- Verify your `Dockerfile` has correct syntax
- Ensure all dependencies are listed in `package.json`
- Check for TypeScript compilation errors in the logs

### Agent Not Starting

**Problem**: Deployment succeeds but agent doesn't run

- Check Railway logs for runtime error messages
- Verify the `CMD` in your Dockerfile points to the correct file
- Ensure all required environment variables are set
- Confirm your build process creates the expected output files (check `dist/` folder exists)

## Railway Best Practices

### Version Control

- Use specific image tags (like `v1.0`, `v1.1`) instead of `latest` for better tracking
- Tag images with version numbers or git commit hashes

### Cost Management

- Set resource limits in Railway's settings to prevent unexpected charges
- Monitor usage in Railway's dashboard
- Use Railway's sleep feature for non-critical deployments

### Reliability

- Enable health checks if your agent exposes an HTTP endpoint
- Use Railway's preview environments to test changes before deploying to production
- Monitor logs regularly to catch issues early

### Security

- Never commit environment variables or secrets to git
- Railway automatically encrypts environment variables
- Rotate API keys and tokens regularly
- Use Railway's audit logs to track changes
