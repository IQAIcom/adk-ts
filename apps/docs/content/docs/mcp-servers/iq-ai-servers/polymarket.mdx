## Features

- Interact with Polymarket prediction markets
- Trade prediction market positions
- Access market data and analytics
- Manage positions and orders

## Environment Variables

<Callout type="warn" title="Security">

Private keys are used for trading operations. Handle with care and never
commit them to version control.

</Callout>

- `FUNDER_ADDRESS`: Required. Available to copy from the user menu dropdown on the Polymarket website (different from the wallet address used to log in).
- `POLYMARKET_PRIVATE_KEY`: Required. Private key of the wallet that interacts with Polymarket.

## Usage Examples

Here's a complete example of using MCP Polymarket with an ADK agent:

```typescript
import { McpPolymarket, AgentBuilder } from "@iqai/adk";
import dotenv from "dotenv";

dotenv.config();

async function main() {
  // Initialize Polymarket MCP toolset
  const toolset = McpPolymarket({
    env: {
      FUNDER_ADDRESS: process.env.FUNDER_ADDRESS,
      POLYMARKET_PRIVATE_KEY: process.env.POLYMARKET_PRIVATE_KEY,
    },
    debug: false,
    retryOptions: {
      maxRetries: 3,
      initialDelay: 500,
    },
  });

  // Get available tools
  const polymarketTools = await toolset.getTools();

  // Create agent with Polymarket tools
  const { runner } = await AgentBuilder.create("polymarket_agent")
    .withModel("gemini-2.5-flash")
    .withDescription(
      "An agent that interacts with Polymarket prediction markets",
    )
    .withTools(...polymarketTools)
    .build();

  try {
    // Example queries
    const response = await runner.ask(
      "Show me available markets on Polymarket",
    );
    console.log(response);
  } finally {
    // Clean up resources
    await toolset.close();
  }
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

## Getting Your Credentials

### Funder Address

1. Log in to [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com)
2. Click on your user menu (dropdown)
3. Copy the **Funder Address** (this is different from your wallet address)

### Private Key

The `POLYMARKET_PRIVATE_KEY` is the private key of the wallet you use to interact with Polymarket. Ensure this wallet has sufficient funds for trading operations.

<Callout type="warn" title="Important">

Never share your private key or commit it to version control. Always use
environment variables or secure secret management systems.

</Callout>

## Best Practices

- **Security**: Store private keys in environment variables, never hardcode them
- **Resource Cleanup**: Always call `await toolset.close()` when done to properly close connections
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling for trading operations
- **Rate Limits**: Be aware of Polymarket API rate limits and implement appropriate retry logic

## Error Handling

<Callout type="warn" title="Error Scenarios">

The server handles various error scenarios gracefully.

</Callout>

🚨 **Missing credentials**: Ensure both `FUNDER_ADDRESS` and `POLYMARKET_PRIVATE_KEY` are set
💸 **Insufficient balance**: Ensure your wallet has sufficient funds for trading operations
🔄 **Invalid market identifiers**: Verify market IDs are correct
🌐 **Network issues**: Check your internet connection and Polymarket API status
🛑 **Transaction failures**: Review transaction details and ensure proper gas settings
