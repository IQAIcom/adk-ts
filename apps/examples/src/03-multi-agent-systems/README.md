# 03 - Multi-Agent Systems

Learn how to create multi-agent systems where agents work together and share information.

## Concepts Covered

- **Output keys** - Passing data between sequential agents
- **Shared memory** - Agents accessing common conversation history
- **Sub-agents** - Delegating tasks to specialized agents
- **LangGraph workflows** - State machine-based agent coordination
- **Agent composition** - Building complex systems from simple agents

## Running the Example

```bash
pnpm dev --name 03-multi-agent-systems
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Output keys** enable data flow between agents in sequence
2. **Shared memory** allows agents to access each other's context
3. **Sub-agents** enable task delegation and specialization
4. **LangGraph** provides state machine patterns for complex workflows
