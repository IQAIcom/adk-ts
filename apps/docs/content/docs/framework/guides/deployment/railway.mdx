import { Callout } from "fumadocs-ui/components/callout";

Railway is a cloud platform that simplifies deploying applications with built-in CI/CD and automatic scaling. **Best for**: Quick deployments, teams wanting managed infrastructure, and developers who prefer simple deployment workflows.

## When to Use Railway

Choose Railway when you:

- Want the fastest path from code to production (5 minutes with auto-deploy)
- Prefer managed infrastructure over self-hosting
- Need automatic deployments from GitHub
- Value built-in monitoring and logging
- Want automatic scaling without manual configuration
- Don't want to learn Docker (Railway can auto-detect your project)

**Not sure?** See the [Platform Comparison](/docs/guides/deployment#platform-comparison) to help decide.

## Prerequisites

**Required:**
- **Railway Account**: Sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
- **GitHub Repository**: Your ADK-TS project pushed to GitHub
- **Built and tested** ADK-TS agent locally
- **Environment variables** documented

**Optional (only for custom Docker builds):**
- **Docker**: Installed locally - [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **DockerHub Account**: For pre-built image deployment

## Deployment Options

Railway offers three deployment methods:

1. **GitHub Auto-Deploy (Nixpacks)**: Railway automatically detects and builds your project (Recommended - No Docker needed)
2. **GitHub with Dockerfile**: Use a custom Dockerfile for advanced build requirements
3. **DockerHub Image**: Build locally, push to DockerHub, deploy from Railway

## Option 1: GitHub Auto-Deploy with Nixpacks (Recommended)

This is the easiest way to deploy - Railway automatically detects your Node.js/TypeScript project and handles everything for you. **No Docker knowledge required.**

### When to Use This Option

Use Nixpacks auto-deploy when your agent:
- Uses standard ADK-TS features (LLM APIs, tools, memory)
- Has a typical TypeScript build process
- Doesn't need special system dependencies or custom build steps
- **This covers most ADK-TS agents**

### Step 1: Prepare Your Project

Ensure your `package.json` has proper build and start scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc",
    "start": "node dist/index.js"
  }
}
```

Railway will automatically run `pnpm install`, `pnpm build`, and then `pnpm start`.

### Step 2: Push to GitHub

Commit and push your code to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Railway deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Connect to Railway

1. Log in to [Railway](https://railway.app)
2. Click **"New Project"**
3. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. Authorize Railway to access your GitHub account (if first time)
5. Choose your ADK-TS repository from the list
6. Railway automatically detects it's a Node.js project and starts building

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

While Railway is building, add your environment variables:

1. In your Railway project, click the **"Variables"** tab
2. Click **"New Variable"** for each required variable
3. Add your configuration (e.g., `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `LLM_MODEL`, `DISCORD_TOKEN`)

See [Environment Variables](/docs/guides/deployment#environment-variables) for security best practices.

### Step 5: Monitor Deployment

Railway automatically deploys after the build completes. Check the **"Deployments"** tab to see:
- Build logs (dependency installation, TypeScript compilation)
- Runtime logs (your agent starting up)
- Deployment status

<Callout type="success" title="Automatic Updates">
  Every time you push to your connected branch, Railway automatically rebuilds and redeploys your agent. No manual steps needed!
</Callout>

### Verifying Your Deployment

After deployment:
- Check Railway logs for successful startup messages
- Test your agent (send a Discord message, make an API call, etc.)
- Monitor the Railway dashboard for resource usage and errors

## Option 2: GitHub with Custom Dockerfile

Use this option when you need more control over the build process or have special requirements.

### When to Use This Option

Use a custom Dockerfile when your agent needs:
- **System-level dependencies** (ffmpeg, Chrome/Puppeteer, image processing libraries)
- **Custom build processes** or optimizations
- **Multi-stage builds** for smaller production images
- **Non-standard runtime** configurations
- **Specific versions** of Node.js or system packages

### Step 1: Add Dockerfile

Use the standard [ADK-TS Dockerfile](/docs/guides/deployment#dockerfile-reference) from the main deployment guide, or create a custom one for your needs.

Also create a [.dockerignore file](/docs/guides/deployment#dockerignore) to optimize builds.

### Step 2: Push to GitHub

Commit your Dockerfile and push:

```bash
git add Dockerfile .dockerignore
git commit -m "Add Dockerfile for Railway deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Connect to Railway

1. Log in to [Railway](https://railway.app)
2. Click **"New Project"**
3. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. Choose your repository
5. Railway will detect the Dockerfile and use it instead of Nixpacks

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

Same as Option 1 - add variables in the Railway dashboard Variables tab.

### Step 5: Monitor Deployment

Railway builds using your Dockerfile and deploys automatically. Monitor the build logs for any Docker-specific issues.

## Option 3: Deploy from DockerHub

### Step 1: Build and Push Docker Image

Use the standard [ADK-TS Dockerfile](/docs/guides/deployment#dockerfile-reference) from the main deployment guide.

**Build for Railway:**

Railway uses AMD64 processors. See [Platform Architecture](/docs/guides/deployment#platform-architecture) for details.

```bash
# Build for Railway (AMD64 platform)
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t your_docker_username/your_agent_name:tag .
```

**Push to DockerHub:**

See the [Docker deployment guide](/docs/guides/deployment/docker#step-3-push-to-container-registry) for detailed registry setup instructions.

```bash
# Login to Docker Hub
docker login

# Push your image
docker push your_docker_username/your_agent_name:tag
```

### Step 2: Set Up Railway Project

In the Railway dashboard:

1. Log in to [Railway](https://railway.app)
2. Click **"New Project"** in the top right
3. Select **"Deploy from Docker Image"** from the options
4. Enter your full image name exactly as you pushed it: `your_docker_username/your_agent_name:tag`
5. Railway will pull your image from Docker Hub

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

See [Environment Variables](/docs/guides/deployment#environment-variables) for an overview and security best practices.

**In Railway:**

1. In your Railway project, find the **"Variables"** tab
2. Click **"New Variable"** for each variable you need
3. Copy the variable names and values from your local `.env` file
4. Add them one by one (e.g., `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `LLM_MODEL`, `DISCORD_TOKEN`)

Railway encrypts environment variables automatically.

### Step 4: Deploy

Click **"Deploy"** to launch your agent. Railway will pull the Docker image and start your container.

## Verifying Deployment

### Check Deployment Status

In your Railway project dashboard:

1. Look for the **"Deployments"** section - it should show "Active" with a green indicator
2. Click on the latest deployment to view detailed logs
3. Check the logs for your agent's startup messages
4. Look for any error messages (shown in red)

### Test Your Agent

Once deployment is active, test that it works:

- **Discord bots**: Send a command in your Discord server
- **Telegram bots**: Message your bot
- **API agents**: Make a test HTTP request to your endpoint
- **Check logs**: Watch Railway logs in real-time to see your agent responding

## Monitoring and Updates

### View Logs

Railway provides real-time logs in the **"Logs"** tab of your deployment. Use them to:

- Debug issues by viewing error messages
- Monitor your agent's activity and responses
- Track warnings or performance issues

### Updating Your Deployment

**For GitHub deployments (Options 1 & 2):**

1. Make code changes locally
2. Test changes locally
3. Commit and push to your connected branch:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update agent features"
   git push origin main
   ```
4. Railway automatically detects changes, rebuilds, and redeploys
5. Watch the deployment logs to confirm success

**For DockerHub deployments (Option 3):**

1. Make code changes locally
2. Build and push new Docker image with a new tag (e.g., `v1.1`)
3. In Railway dashboard, update the image reference to the new tag
4. Railway pulls the new image and redeploys automatically
