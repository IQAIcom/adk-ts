Parallel agents execute multiple sub-agents simultaneously, allowing independent tasks to run concurrently for improved performance.

## Quick Example

Here's how to create a research workflow that runs three specialized agents in parallel:

```typescript
// Create three specialized research agents
const { agent: webAgent } = await AgentBuilder
  .create("web-researcher")
  .withModel("gemini-2.5-flash")
  .withTools(new GoogleSearchTool())
  .withInstruction("Search the web for current information")
  .build();

const { agent: wikiAgent } = await AgentBuilder
  .create("wiki-researcher")
  .withModel("gemini-2.5-flash")
  .withTools(new WikipediaTool())
  .withInstruction("Find comprehensive background information")
  .build();

const { agent: newsAgent } = await AgentBuilder
  .create("news-researcher")
  .withModel("gemini-2.5-flash")
  .withTools(new NewsTool())
  .withInstruction("Find latest news and developments")
  .build();

// Create parallel coordinator that runs all three simultaneously
const { runner } = await AgentBuilder
  .create("research-coordinator")
  .withDescription("Coordinates parallel research across multiple sources")
  .asParallel([webAgent, wikiAgent, newsAgent])
  .build();

// All three agents will research simultaneously
const result = await runner.ask("Research the latest developments in quantum computing");
```

## Key Benefits

- **Speed**: Independent tasks run concurrently instead of sequentially
- **Efficiency**: Better resource utilization for unrelated work
- **Scalability**: Handle multiple data sources or perspectives simultaneously

## When to Use

<Callout type="info" title="Independence Required">
Use parallel agents only when tasks are truly independent and don't need to share results during execution.
</Callout>

**Ideal for:**
- Multi-source research (web, news, academic papers)
- Content analysis (fact-checking + grammar + style review)
- Data validation across different systems
- Getting multiple expert perspectives

**Avoid when:**
- Tasks depend on each other's results
- Sequential processing is required
- Resource constraints limit concurrent execution
