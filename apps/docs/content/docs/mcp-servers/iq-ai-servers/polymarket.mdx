- **Package**: [`@iqai/mcp-polymarket`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@iqai/mcp-polymarket)
- **Provider**: [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com)

## Overview

The Polymarket MCP server gives your agent access to Polymarket, a leading decentralized prediction market. It can fetch active markets, retrieve current prices and liquidity, query positions, and place or cancel orders — enabling agents to interact with prediction markets programmatically.

<Callout type="warn" title="Wallet Required">
  Trading on Polymarket requires a funded wallet and your funder address. Keep
  your private key secure and never commit it to source control.
</Callout>

## Getting Started

Install the package:

```bash
pnpm add @iqai/mcp-polymarket
```

Use the server in your agent:
