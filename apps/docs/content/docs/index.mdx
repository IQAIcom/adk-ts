This is a TypeScript port of the original Python ADK. Features and stability may vary as development continues.

## What is ADK TypeScript?

Agent Development Kit (ADK) **for** TypeScript is a flexible and modular framework for **developing and deploying AI agents using TypeScript**. ADK integrates seamlessly with Google's Gemini models and is designed with a focus on **tight integration with the Google ecosystem**.

ADK TypeScript makes it **easy to get started with simple agents** while providing the control and structure needed for **complex agent architectures and orchestration** within the Node.js environment.

## Quick Start

Get started in seconds with a simple agent:

```typescript title="simple-agent.ts"
import { AgentBuilder } from "@iqai/adk";

// The simplest possible usage - just model and ask!
const response = await AgentBuilder
  .withModel("gemini-2.5-flash")
  .ask("What is the capital of France?");

console.log(response); // "The capital of France is Paris."
```
