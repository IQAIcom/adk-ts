---

import { Callout } from "fumadocs-ui/components/callout";

Railway is a cloud platform that simplifies deploying applications with built-in CI/CD and automatic scaling. **Best for**: Quick deployments, teams wanting managed infrastructure, and developers who prefer simple deployment workflows.

## Prerequisites

**Required:**

- **Railway Account**: Sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
- **GitHub Repository**: Your ADK-TS project pushed to GitHub
- **Built and tested** ADK-TS agent locally
- **Environment variables** documented

**Optional (only for custom Docker builds):**

- **Docker**: Installed locally - [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **DockerHub Account**: For pre-built image deployment

## Deployment Options

Railway offers three deployment methods:

1. **GitHub Auto-Deploy (Railpack)**: Railway automatically detects and builds your project (Recommended - No Docker needed)
2. **GitHub with Dockerfile**: Use a custom Dockerfile for advanced build requirements
3. **DockerHub Image**: Build locally, push to DockerHub, deploy from Railway

## Option 1: GitHub Auto-Deploy with Railpack (Recommended)

This is the easiest way to deploy to Railway. It automatically detects your Node.js/TypeScript project and handles everything for you using **Railpack**, Railway's modern build system. **No Docker knowledge required.**

### When to Use This Option

Use Railpack auto-deploy when your agent:

- Uses standard ADK-TS features (LLM APIs, tools, memory)
- Has a typical TypeScript build process
- Doesn't need special system dependencies or custom build steps

### Step 1: Prepare Your Project

Ensure your `package.json` has proper build and start scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc",
    "start": "node dist/index.js"
  }
}
```

Railway will automatically run `pnpm install`, `pnpm build`, and then `pnpm start`.

### Step 2: Push to GitHub

Commit and push your code to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Railway deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Connect to Railway

1. Log in to [Railway](https://railway.app)
2. Click **"New Project"**
3. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. Authorize Railway to access your GitHub account (if first time)
5. Choose your ADK-TS repository from the list
6. Railway automatically detects it's a Node.js project and starts building

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

**In Railway:**

1. In your Railway project, click the **"Variables"** tab
2. Click **"New Variable"** for each required variable
3. Add your configuration:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_API_KEY` (depending on your LLM provider)
   - `LLM_MODEL` (e.g., `gpt-4`, `gemini-2.5-flash`)
   - Bot tokens (`DISCORD_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, etc.)
   - Any other variables your agent needs

Railway encrypts all environment variables automatically.

### Step 5: Monitor Deployment

Railway automatically deploys after the build completes. Check the **"Deployments"** tab to see:

- Build logs (dependency installation, TypeScript compilation)
- Runtime logs (your agent starting up)
- Deployment status

<Callout type="success" title="Automatic Updates">
  Every time you push to your connected branch, Railway automatically rebuilds
  and redeploys your agent. No manual steps needed!
</Callout>

### Verifying Your Deployment

After deployment:

- Check Railway logs for successful startup messages
- Test your agent (send a Discord message, make an API call, etc.)
- Monitor the Railway dashboard for resource usage and errors

## Option 2: GitHub with Custom Dockerfile

Use this option when you need more control over the build process or have special requirements.

### When to Use This Option

Use a custom Dockerfile when your agent needs:

- **System-level dependencies** (ffmpeg, Chrome/Puppeteer, image processing libraries)
- **Custom build processes** or optimizations
- **Multi-stage builds** for smaller production images
- **Non-standard runtime** configurations
- **Specific versions** of Node.js or system packages

### Step 1: Push Dockerfile to GitHub

Commit and push your `Dockerfile` to your GitHub repository:

```bash
git add Dockerfile .dockerignore
git commit -m "Add Dockerfile for Railway deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Connect to Railway

1. Log in to [Railway](https://railway.app)
2. Click **"New Project"**
3. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. Authorize Railway to access your GitHub account (first time only)
5. Choose your repository from the list
6. Select the branch to deploy (usually main)
7. Railway will detect the Dockerfile and use it for building

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Add your environment variables in Railway's "Variables" tab, just like in Option 1.

### Step 4: Automatic Deployment

Railway now handles everything automatically:

- First deployment: Detects your Dockerfile, builds the image, and deploys
- Future updates: Every time you push to your connected branch, Railway rebuilds and redeploys
- No manual steps needed after initial setup

## Option 3: Deploy from DockerHub

### Step 1: Build and Push Docker Image

Create a `Dockerfile` in your project root:

```dockerfile
# Use Node.js 20 Alpine as the base image (lightweight Linux distribution)
FROM node:20-alpine

# Enable pnpm package manager and set a specific version for consistency
RUN corepack enable && corepack prepare pnpm@9.12.0 --activate

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files first for better Docker layer caching
COPY package.json pnpm-lock.yaml ./

# Install dependencies using frozen lockfile for reproducible builds
RUN pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

# Copy TypeScript config and source code
COPY tsconfig.json ./
COPY src ./src

# Build the project
RUN pnpm build

# Set production environment
ENV NODE_ENV=production

# Define the command to run when the container starts
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

**Build for Railway:**

Railway uses AMD64 processors, so build specifically for that platform:

```bash
# Build for Railway (AMD64 platform)
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t your_docker_username/your_agent_name:tag .
```

Replace `your_docker_username` with your Docker Hub username, `your_agent_name` with your project name, and `tag` with a version (like `v1.0` or `latest`).

**Push to DockerHub:**

1. Login to Docker Hub:

```bash
docker login
```

2. Push your image:

```bash
docker push your_docker_username/your_agent_name:tag
```

### Step 2: Set Up Railway Project

In the Railway dashboard:

1. Log in to [Railway](https://railway.app)
2. Click **"New Project"** in the top right
3. Select **"Deploy from Docker Image"** from the options
4. Enter your full image name exactly as you pushed it: `your_docker_username/your_agent_name:tag`
5. Railway will pull your image from Docker Hub

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Add variables in the Railway dashboard Variables tab (same process as Option 1).

### Step 4: Deploy

Click **"Deploy"** to launch your agent. Railway will pull the Docker image and start your container.

## Verifying Deployment

### Check Deployment Status

In your Railway project dashboard:

1. Look for the **"Deployments"** section - it should show "Active" with a green indicator
2. Click on the latest deployment to view detailed logs
3. Check the logs for your agent's startup messages
4. Look for any error messages (shown in red)

### Test Your Agent

Once deployment is active, test that it works:

- **Discord bots**: Send a command in your Discord server
- **Telegram bots**: Message your bot
- **API agents**: Make a test HTTP request to your endpoint
- **Check logs**: Watch Railway logs in real-time to see your agent responding

## Monitoring and Updates

### View Logs

Railway provides real-time logs in the **"Logs"** tab of your deployment. Use them to:

- Debug issues by viewing error messages
- Monitor your agent's activity and responses
- Track warnings or performance issues

### Updating Your Deployment

**For GitHub deployments (Options 1 & 2):**

1. Make code changes locally
2. Test changes locally
3. Commit and push to your connected branch:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update agent features"
   git push origin main
   ```
4. Railway automatically detects changes, rebuilds, and redeploys
5. Watch the deployment logs to confirm success

**For DockerHub deployments (Option 3):**

1. Make code changes locally
2. Build and push new Docker image with a new tag (e.g., `v1.1`)
3. In Railway dashboard, update the image reference to the new tag
4. Railway pulls the new image and redeploys automatically

## Troubleshooting

### Docker Push Fails

**Problem**: Can't push image to Docker Hub

- Verify you're logged in (run `docker login`)
- Check your image name format matches `username/image:tag`
- Confirm you have permission to push to this repository
- Check your internet connection

### Missing Environment Variables

**Problem**: Agent crashes or features don't work

- Go to Railway's **"Variables"** tab and verify all variables are present
- Check that variable names match exactly what your code expects (case-sensitive)
- Look for typos in variable values
- Restart the deployment after adding missing variables

### Build Failures

**Problem**: Railway build fails

- Click on the failed deployment to view detailed build logs
- Look for error messages about missing dependencies or syntax errors
- Verify your `Dockerfile` has correct syntax
- Ensure all dependencies are listed in `package.json`
- Check for TypeScript compilation errors in the logs

### Agent Not Starting

**Problem**: Deployment succeeds but agent doesn't run

- Check Railway logs for runtime error messages
- Verify the `CMD` in your Dockerfile points to the correct file
- Ensure all required environment variables are set
- Confirm your build process creates the expected output files (check `dist/` folder exists)

## Best Practices

### Version Control

- Use specific image tags (like `v1.0`, `v1.1`) instead of `latest` for better tracking
- Tag images with version numbers or git commit hashes

### Cost Management

- Set resource limits in Railway's settings to prevent unexpected charges
- Monitor usage in Railway's dashboard
- Use Railway's sleep feature for non-critical deployments

### Reliability

- Enable health checks if your agent exposes an HTTP endpoint
- Use Railway's preview environments to test changes before deploying to production
- Monitor logs regularly to catch issues early

### Security

- Never commit environment variables or secrets to git
- Railway automatically encrypts environment variables
- Rotate API keys and tokens regularly
- Use Railway's audit logs to track changes
