Parallel agents unleash the power of concurrent processing, running multiple agents simultaneously to tackle independent tasks. Think of it as your AI team working in parallel - while one agent analyzes sentiment, another extracts topics, and a third generates summaries, all at the same time.

Unlike [sequential agents](/docs/framework/agents/workflow-agents/sequential-agents) that process step-by-step, parallel agents maximize speed and efficiency by utilizing multiple processing streams. Perfect when you have independent tasks that don't need to wait for each other.

<Callout type="info" title="Speed Through Parallelism">
  - **Key benefit:** Process multiple independent tasks simultaneously instead of waiting for each one to finish.
  - **Performance boost:** 3 tasks that take 10 seconds each = 10 seconds total (not 30!)
</Callout>

## Quick Start Example

Here's a comprehensive parallel analysis agent that evaluates user feedback from multiple angles simultaneously:

```typescript
import { LlmAgent, ParallelAgent } from "@iqai/adk";

// Parallel analysis agents for user feedback - each analyzes different aspects simultaneously
const sentimentAgent = new LlmAgent({
  name: "sentiment_agent",
  description:
    "Analyzes the overall sentiment and emotional tone of user feedback",
  instruction: `Analyze the sentiment of the user feedback. Classify as positive, negative, or neutral, and provide a confidence score. Identify specific emotional indicators.`,
  outputKey: "sentiment_analysis", // Key for storing sentiment results
});

const topicAgent = new LlmAgent({
  name: "topic_agent",
  description: "Categorizes feedback into relevant topics and themes",
  instruction: `Identify the main topics and themes in the user feedback. Categorize into areas like product features, customer service, pricing, usability, etc. List specific topics mentioned.`,
  outputKey: "topic_categories", // Key for storing topic results
});

const issueAgent = new LlmAgent({
  name: "issue_agent",
  description:
    "Identifies specific problems, bugs, or concerns mentioned in feedback",
  instruction: `Extract and categorize any specific issues, problems, or concerns mentioned in the feedback. Prioritize critical issues and suggest severity levels.`,
  outputKey: "identified_issues", // Key for storing issue results
});

const suggestionAgent = new LlmAgent({
  name: "suggestion_agent",
  description: "Extracts user suggestions and improvement ideas",
  instruction: `Identify any suggestions, recommendations, or improvement ideas mentioned in the feedback. Organize them by category and feasibility.`,
  outputKey: "user_suggestions", // Key for storing suggestion results
});

const satisfactionAgent = new LlmAgent({
  name: "satisfaction_agent",
  description: "Rates overall user satisfaction and likelihood to recommend",
  instruction: `Rate the user's overall satisfaction on a scale of 1-10. Assess likelihood to recommend and identify key satisfaction drivers or pain points.`,
  outputKey: "satisfaction_rating", // Key for storing satisfaction results
});

// Parallel analysis system - demonstrates concurrent execution pattern
const feedbackAgent = new ParallelAgent({
  name: "feedback_agent",
  description:
    "Comprehensive parallel analysis of user feedback across multiple dimensions",
  subAgents: [
    sentimentAgent,
    topicAgent,
    issueAgent,
    suggestionAgent,
    satisfactionAgent,
  ],
});

// Export the parallel agent for use
export { feedbackAgent };
```

## How Parallel Processing Works

Parallel agents maximize efficiency by running all sub-agents simultaneously:

**⚡ Concurrent Execution**

1. **All agents start together** - No waiting for previous agents to finish
2. **Independent processing** - Each agent works on the same input independently
3. **Simultaneous completion** - Results become available as each agent finishes
4. **Non-deterministic order** - Faster agents finish first, slower ones catch up

**📊 Performance Benefits**

- **Time savings:** N agents running for T seconds = T total time (not N×T)
- **Resource utilization:** Maximizes CPU/GPU usage across multiple agents
- **Scalability:** Add more agents without increasing total processing time

**🔄 Result Aggregation**
Each agent writes to unique keys in shared session state. Later agents (or your application) can access all results together for final processing.

<Callout type="info" title="State Management">
  Use unique `outputKey` values for each agent to prevent conflicts. Results are
  available immediately as each agent completes - perfect for real-time updates!
</Callout>

## Real-World Use Cases

**📝 Multi-Perspective Content Analysis**  
Sentiment + Topics + Keywords + Priority Assessment (all simultaneously)

**🔍 Comprehensive Research**  
Web Search + Academic Papers + News + Social Media (parallel data gathering)

**📊 Financial Analysis**  
Technical Analysis + Fundamental Analysis + News Sentiment + Risk Assessment

**🛠️ Quality Assurance**  
Grammar Check + Fact Verification + Style Review + Compliance Check

**🌍 Multi-Language Processing**  
Translation + Sentiment + Cultural Context + Localization (per language)

**📊 Data Validation**  
Format Check + Business Rules + Data Quality + Duplicate Detection

## When to Choose Parallel Agents

<Callout type="success" title="Perfect For Independent Tasks">
  - **Use when:** Tasks don't depend on each other's results during execution
  - **Benefit:** Dramatic speed improvements through simultaneous processing
</Callout>

### ✅ Choose Parallel When:

- **Independent analysis** - Multiple perspectives on the same data
- **Speed is critical** - Need results as fast as possible
- **Resource optimization** - Want to maximize processing power
- **Multi-source data** - Gathering from different sources simultaneously
- **Comparative analysis** - Need multiple approaches to the same problem

### ❌ Don't Use Parallel When:

- Tasks depend on each other's intermediate results
- You need guaranteed execution order
- Sequential processing is part of the business logic
- Resource constraints limit concurrent execution
- Results from one agent affect how another should process
