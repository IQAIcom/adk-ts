Custom agents provide ultimate flexibility by allowing you to define arbitrary orchestration logic. They go beyond predefined workflow patterns to enable highly specific and complex agent behaviors.

<Callout type="warn" title="Advanced Concept">
Building custom agents requires implementing core execution logic directly. We recommend understanding LLM agents and workflow agents first before tackling custom orchestration.
</Callout>

## What Are Custom Agents?

Custom agents inherit from `BaseAgent` and implement their own control flow by defining the `_run_async_impl` method. You have complete control over:

- How sub-agents are called and orchestrated
- State management and data flow
- Conditional logic and decision making
- External integrations and API calls

## When to Use Custom Agents

Consider custom agents when you need:

- **Conditional Logic**: Different execution paths based on runtime conditions
- **Complex State Management**: Intricate logic for maintaining workflow state
- **External Integrations**: Direct API calls, database operations, or custom libraries
- **Dynamic Agent Selection**: Choosing sub-agents based on runtime evaluation
- **Unique Patterns**: Orchestration logic that doesn't fit standard patterns

<Callout type="info" title="Design Decision">
Use custom agents when predefined workflow agents (Sequential, Parallel, Loop) cannot express your required logic patterns.
</Callout>

## Core Implementation

### The `_run_async_impl` Method

This is the heart of every custom agent:

- **Asynchronous Generator**: Must yield events back to the runner
- **Context Access**: Receive `InvocationContext` for session and state access
- **Event Handling**: Process and forward events from sub-agents
- **Custom Logic**: Implement any required control flow

## Design Patterns

### Conditional Workflows
Execute different agent paths based on runtime conditions or previous results.

### State-Driven Orchestration
Use session state to coordinate complex data flows between multiple agents.

### External Service Integration
Combine agent capabilities with external APIs and data sources.

### Dynamic Agent Selection
Choose which agents to execute based on input analysis or environment conditions.

## Managing Sub-Agents

### Agent Hierarchy
- Store sub-agents as instance attributes during initialization
- Declare sub-agents in the `sub_agents` list for framework awareness
- Use direct method calls for orchestration within your custom logic

### State Coordination
- Use `ctx.session.state` for data sharing between agents
- Leverage `output_key` parameters for structured data flow
- Implement state validation and error handling

### Event Processing
- Yield events from sub-agents to maintain streaming behavior
- Optionally inspect, filter, or transform events
- Handle error events and implement recovery logic

## Best Practices

<Callout type="warn" title="Design Considerations">
- Keep custom logic focused and well-documented
- Design clear interfaces between sub-agents
- Implement proper error handling and recovery
- Test complex workflows thoroughly with various scenarios
</Callout>

### Architecture Design
- Break complex workflows into logical sub-agents
- Use clear naming conventions for state keys
- Document the expected data flow and dependencies
- Design for testability and maintainability

### Error Handling
- Implement graceful degradation for agent failures
- Use try-catch blocks around critical operations
- Provide meaningful error messages and logging
- Consider retry logic for transient failures

### Performance Considerations
- Minimize unnecessary state operations
- Consider async/await patterns for external calls
- Implement timeouts for long-running operations
- Monitor resource usage in complex workflows

## Testing Custom Agents

### Unit Testing
- Test individual logic components separately
- Mock sub-agents for isolated testing
- Verify state management logic
- Test error conditions and edge cases

### Integration Testing
- Test complete workflows end-to-end
- Verify state flow between agents
- Test with realistic data scenarios
- Validate error handling and recovery

### Performance Testing
- Measure execution times for complex workflows
- Test resource usage under load
- Verify timeout and limit behaviors
- Monitor memory usage patterns

## Common Use Cases

### Multi-Stage Content Generation
Create content through generation, critique, revision, and validation stages with conditional regeneration.

### Data Processing Pipelines
Implement complex ETL workflows with conditional transformations and quality checks.

### Decision Support Systems
Build agents that analyze data, consult multiple sources, and provide structured recommendations.

### Quality Assurance Workflows
Implement multi-step validation processes with conditional approval and revision cycles.
