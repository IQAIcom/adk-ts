Memory systems provide agents with long-term knowledge storage and retrieval capabilities, extending beyond single conversation sessions. While sessions manage immediate conversation context, memory services create searchable archives of past interactions and external knowledge.

## Memory vs Session Context

Understanding the distinction between session context and long-term memory is crucial for building intelligent agents.

### Session Context: Short-Term Memory

- **Scope**: Current conversation thread only
- **Duration**: Temporary, conversation-specific
- **Content**: Recent interactions, current state, immediate context
- **Use Cases**: Maintaining conversation flow, tracking current tasks

### Long-Term Memory: Knowledge Archive

- **Scope**: Cross-session, historical information
- **Duration**: Persistent, long-term storage
- **Content**: Past conversations, learned information, external knowledge
- **Use Cases**: Recalling previous discussions, building on past interactions

<Callout type="info" title="Memory Analogy">
Think of session context as your working memory during a meeting, while long-term memory is like your searchable archive of all past meetings and knowledge.
</Callout>

## MemoryService Architecture

The MemoryService provides a unified interface for managing long-term knowledge storage and retrieval across different storage backends.

### Service Interface

All MemoryService implementations provide consistent methods:

- **`addSessionToMemory()`**: Store completed session information
- **`searchMemory()`**: Query knowledge base for relevant information
- **`store()`/`retrieve()`/`delete()`**: Key-value storage operations
- **`clearMemory()`**: Remove stored information when needed

## Memory Workflow

### Typical Memory Lifecycle

1. **Session Interaction**: User interacts with agent through sessions
2. **Information Capture**: Session events and outcomes recorded
3. **Memory Ingestion**: Completed sessions added to long-term storage
4. **Knowledge Query**: Future sessions search memory for relevant context
5. **Context Retrieval**: Relevant past information retrieved and used
6. **Enhanced Responses**: Agents use retrieved knowledge for better answers

### Integration Patterns

**Automatic Ingestion:**
- Sessions automatically archived when completed
- Configurable rules for what information to store
- Background processing to avoid blocking interactions

**On-Demand Search:**
- Agents use memory tools to search when needed
- Query optimization for relevant information retrieval
- Context-aware search to improve relevance

**Hybrid Approaches:**
- Combination of automatic and manual memory management
- Selective ingestion based on conversation importance
- Intelligent caching and pre-loading strategies
