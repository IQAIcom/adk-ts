Sequential agents execute a list of sub-agents one after another in a predetermined order. Each agent runs after the previous one completes, creating a predictable pipeline workflow.

## How Sequential Agents Work

1. **Ordered Execution**: Agents run in the exact order you specify
2. **Sequential Processing**: Each agent waits for the previous one to complete
3. **Context Sharing**: Results flow through the conversation context
4. **State Passing**: Use session state to pass structured data between agents

## When to Use Sequential Agents

Sequential agents are perfect for:

- **Multi-step pipelines** - Research â†’ Analysis â†’ Summary
- **Data processing workflows** - Extract â†’ Transform â†’ Load
- **Quality assurance** - Generate â†’ Review â†’ Approve
- **Progressive refinement** - Draft â†’ Edit â†’ Finalize

<Callout type="info" title="Order Matters">
Use sequential agents when the order of execution is important and each step depends on the previous ones.
</Callout>

## Configuration

### Basic Setup
- **agents**: List of agents to execute in order
- **name**: Unique identifier for the workflow
- **description**: Summary for other agents to understand the workflow

### Advanced Options
- **max_iterations**: Limit the number of execution cycles
- **global_instruction**: Instructions that apply to all sub-agents
- **disallow_transfer**: Control agent delegation behavior

## Common Patterns

### Research Pipeline
Execute research, then analysis, then summarization in sequence.

### Content Creation Workflow
Generate content, review for accuracy, then format for publication.

### Data Processing Pipeline
Extract data, transform it, then load it into the target system.

### Quality Assurance Workflow
Create initial content, perform quality checks, then make final adjustments.

## Best Practices

<Callout type="warn" title="Design Considerations">
- Keep the number of sequential steps reasonable (3-7 agents typically)
- Ensure each agent has a clear, specific purpose
- Use descriptive names and instructions for better coordination
- Consider error handling between steps
</Callout>

### Agent Design
- Make each agent's purpose clear and specific
- Design agents to work well with the outputs of previous agents
- Use consistent naming conventions across the workflow

### Data Flow
- Plan how data will flow between agents
- Use session state for structured data passing
- Consider what context each agent needs

### Error Handling
- Design agents to handle unexpected inputs gracefully
- Consider retry logic for critical steps
- Plan for partial failure scenarios
