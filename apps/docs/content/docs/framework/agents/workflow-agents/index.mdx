Workflow agents provide deterministic orchestration patterns for coordinating multiple agents. Unlike LLM agents that make dynamic decisions, workflow agents follow predictable execution paths.

## Quick Example

Here's a simple example of a sequential workflow that uses a writer agent followed by an editor agent:

```typescript
import { AgentBuilder, LlmAgent } from '@iqai/adk';

// 1. Define the sub-agents
const writerAgent = new LlmAgent({
  name: 'writer',
  model: 'gemini-2.5-flash',
  instruction: 'You are a creative writer. Write a short story based on the user prompt.',
});

const editorAgent = new LlmAgent({
  name: 'editor',
  model: 'gemini-2.5-flash',
  instruction: 'You are an editor. Review the story for grammar and style, then provide a final version.',
});

// 2. Create the sequential workflow
const { runner } = await AgentBuilder.create('story-pipeline')
  .asSequential([writerAgent, editorAgent])
  .build();

// 3. Run the workflow
const result = await runner.ask('Write a story about a robot who discovers music.');

console.log(result);
```

## When to Use Workflow Agents

Workflow agents are ideal for:

- **Predictable pipelines** - When you need guaranteed execution order
- **Data processing workflows** - Multi-step data transformation and analysis
- **Quality assurance** - Review and validation workflows
- **Performance optimization** - Parallel processing of independent tasks
- **Iterative improvement** - Repeated refinement until criteria are met

## Key Benefits

### Deterministic Execution
Unlike LLM agents, workflow agents provide predictable, repeatable execution patterns.

### Composition
Combine different workflow types to create complex orchestration patterns.

### Error Handling
Built-in error handling and recovery mechanisms for robust workflows.

### Performance Control
Optimize execution with parallel processing and conditional loops.

## Workflow Patterns

<Callout type="info" title="Common Patterns">
- **Research Pipeline**: Sequential research â†’ analysis â†’ summary
- **Content Review**: Parallel fact-checking and grammar review
- **Iterative Refinement**: Loop until quality criteria are met
- **Distributed Processing**: Parallel execution across data partitions
</Callout>

## Choosing the Right Workflow

- **Sequential**: When order matters and each step depends on the previous
- **Parallel**: When tasks are independent and can run simultaneously
- **Loop**: When you need iterative improvement or retry logic

## Advanced Features

### Nested Workflows
Workflow agents can contain other workflow agents for complex patterns.

### Conditional Execution
Control flow based on agent outputs and session state.

### Result Aggregation
Combine results from multiple agents into coherent outputs.

### State Management
Pass data between agents using session state and context.

## Getting Started

Start with the workflow type that matches your use case:

1. **[Sequential Agents](/docs/agents/workflow-agents/sequential-agents)** - For step-by-step processes
2. **[Parallel Agents](/docs/agents/workflow-agents/parallel-agents)** - For independent tasks
3. **[Loop Agents](/docs/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents)** - For iterative processes
