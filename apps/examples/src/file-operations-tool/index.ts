/**
 * File Operations Tool Example
 *
 * This example demonstrates how to use the FileOperationsTool to enable
 * agents to perform file system operations such as reading, writing,
 * creating directories, and listing contents within a secure base path.
 *
 * The example:
 * 1. Creates a temporary directory for safe file operations
 * 2. Sets up an agent with FileOperationsTool capabilities
 * 3. Demonstrates file creation, reading, and directory operations
 * 4. Shows directory traversal and subdirectory operations
 * 5. Ensures all operations are confined to the specified base path
 *
 * Expected Output:
 * - File creation and writing operations
 * - File reading and content verification
 * - Directory listing and navigation
 * - Subdirectory creation and management
 * - Files created in the temp-examples directory
 *
 * Prerequisites:
 * - Node.js environment
 * - LLM_MODEL environment variable (optional, defaults to gemini-2.5-flash)
 * - Write permissions for creating temporary directories
