Parallel agents execute multiple sub-agents simultaneously, allowing independent tasks to run concurrently for improved performance and efficiency.

## How Parallel Agents Work

1. **Concurrent Execution**: All agents start at the same time
2. **Independent Processing**: Agents run without waiting for each other
3. **Result Aggregation**: Collect and combine results when all agents complete
4. **Performance Optimization**: Reduce total execution time for independent tasks

## When to Use Parallel Agents

Parallel agents are ideal for:

- **Independent tasks** - Multiple research queries that don't depend on each other
- **Data validation** - Simultaneous fact-checking and grammar review
- **Distributed processing** - Processing different data partitions
- **Comparative analysis** - Getting multiple perspectives on the same topic

<Callout type="info" title="Independence Required">
Use parallel agents only when tasks are truly independent and don't need to share results during execution.
</Callout>

## Configuration

### Basic Setup
- **agents**: List of agents to execute in parallel
- **name**: Unique identifier for the workflow
- **description**: Summary for other agents to understand the workflow

### Advanced Options
- **max_concurrent**: Limit the number of agents running simultaneously
- **timeout**: Set maximum execution time for the parallel execution
- **fail_fast**: Stop all agents if one fails (default: false)

## Common Patterns

### Multi-Source Research
Query different information sources simultaneously for comprehensive research.

### Content Review Workflow
Run fact-checking, grammar review, and style analysis in parallel.

### Distributed Data Processing
Process different data sets or partitions simultaneously.

### Comparative Analysis
Get multiple expert opinions or analysis perspectives on the same input.

## Result Handling

### Aggregation Strategies
- **Combine all results**: Merge outputs from all agents
- **Best result selection**: Choose the highest quality response
- **Consensus building**: Find common themes across results
- **Structured compilation**: Organize results by agent type or topic

### Error Handling
- **Graceful degradation**: Continue with successful results if some agents fail
- **Retry mechanisms**: Restart failed agents while others continue
- **Partial results**: Handle scenarios where not all agents complete

## Best Practices

<Callout type="warn" title="Design Considerations">
- Ensure tasks are truly independent before using parallel execution
- Consider resource usage when running many agents simultaneously
- Plan how to handle varying completion times
- Design clear result aggregation strategies
</Callout>

### Performance Optimization
- Limit concurrent agents based on system resources
- Use timeouts to prevent hanging executions
- Consider the trade-off between parallelism and resource usage

### Result Quality
- Design consistent output formats across parallel agents
- Plan for varying result quality and completeness
- Consider how to handle conflicting information

### Resource Management
- Monitor system resource usage with parallel execution
- Consider rate limits for external API calls
- Plan for network and memory constraints
