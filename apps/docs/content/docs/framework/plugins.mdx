# Plugins

Plugins extend your agent's capabilities with specialized functionality that applies across your entire workflow. They use callback hooks to intercept, modify, and enhance agent behavior at key lifecycle points.

## Overview

For comprehensive plugin documentation, examples, and the complete list of available plugins, visit the [Plugins Overview](/docs/plugins) page.

## Plugin Concepts

Plugins in ADK-TS are designed for cross-cutting concerns that apply across your entire agent workflow:

- **Global Scope**: Registered once on the Runner, applied to all agents, tools, and model calls
- **Callback Hooks**: Intercept at specific lifecycle points (before/after tool calls, model calls, etc.)
- **Intervention vs Observation**: Plugins can observe (return undefined) or intervene (return values)
- **Priority Execution**: Plugin callbacks run before agent-level callbacks

## Basic Usage

```typescript
import { InMemoryRunner, LlmAgent } from "@iqai/adk";
import { ToolOutputFilterPlugin } from "@iqai/adk";

const agent = new LlmAgent({
  name: "assistant",
  description: "Helpful assistant",
  model: "gemini-1.5-flash",
});

const runner = new InMemoryRunner(agent, {
  appName: "my-app",
  plugins: [
    new ToolOutputFilterPlugin({
      filterModel: "gemini-1.5-flash",
    }),
  ],
});
```
