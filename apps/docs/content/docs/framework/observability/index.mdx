ADK-TS provides first-class observability support through comprehensive OpenTelemetry integration. Monitor your agents' performance, trace execution flows, collect metrics, and gain insights into LLM interactions, tool usage, and agent behavior.

## Overview

The observability system in ADK-TS is built on OpenTelemetry, providing:

- **Distributed Tracing** - Track agent invocations, tool executions, and LLM calls across your system
- **Metrics Collection** - Monitor performance with counters, histograms, and token usage tracking
- **Auto-Instrumentation** - Automatic tracing of HTTP calls, database queries, and file operations
- **Privacy Controls** - Configurable content capture for production environments
- **Platform Integration** - Works with Jaeger, Grafana, Datadog, New Relic, Honeycomb, and more

<Callout type="info" title="Built-in Support">
  All telemetry dependencies are included in `@iqai/adk`. No additional
  installation required.
</Callout>

## Quick Example

```typescript
import { telemetryService } from "@iqai/adk";

// Initialize telemetry
await telemetryService.initialize({
  appName: "my-agent-app",
  appVersion: "1.0.0",
  otlpEndpoint: "http://localhost:4318/v1/traces",
  enableMetrics: true,
  enableTracing: true,
});

// Your agents automatically send traces and metrics
const agent = AgentBuilder.withModel("gemini-2.5-flash").build();
const response = await agent.ask("Hello!");
```

## Architecture

The observability system follows a modular architecture:

```
Application
    ↓
TelemetryService
    ├─ Setup Service
    ├─ Tracing Service
    ├─ Metrics Service
    └─ Utilities
    ↓
OpenTelemetry SDK
    ├─ TracerProvider
    └─ MeterProvider
    ↓
OTLP Exporters
    ├─ Trace Exporter
    └─ Metric Exporter
    ↓
Backend (Jaeger, Tempo, etc.)
```
