- **Name**: MCP CoinGecko Pro
- **Package**: Remote endpoint (no installation required)
- **Endpoint**: `https://mcp.pro-api.coingecko.com/mcp`

## Overview

MCP CoinGecko Pro is a Model Context Protocol server that provides access to CoinGecko's professional-grade cryptocurrency market data API. Unlike the free CoinGecko API, the Pro version offers enhanced features, higher rate limits, and more comprehensive data access, making it ideal for production applications and professional trading operations.

This MCP server connects to CoinGecko's remote endpoint, eliminating the need for local package installation and providing seamless access to real-time cryptocurrency data.

<Callout type="info" title="Pro vs Free">
  CoinGecko Pro offers higher rate limits, more frequent data updates, and
  access to premium endpoints not available in the free tier. Use
  `McpCoinGeckoPro` for production applications and `McpCoinGecko` for
  development/testing. For detailed pricing and plan comparison, visit
  [CoinGecko API Pricing](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/pricing).

## Complete Integration Example

Here's a complete example of building a cryptocurrency analysis agent using MCP CoinGecko Pro:

```typescript
import { McpCoinGeckoPro, AgentBuilder } from "@iqai/adk";
import dotenv from "dotenv";

dotenv.config();

async function main() {
  // Initialize CoinGecko Pro MCP toolset
  const toolset = McpCoinGeckoPro({
    env: {
      COINGECKO_PRO_API_KEY: process.env.COINGECKO_PRO_API_KEY,
    },
    debug: false,
    retryOptions: {
      maxRetries: 3,
      initialDelay: 500,
    },
  });

  // Get available tools
  const coinGeckoTools = await toolset.getTools();

  // Create agent with CoinGecko Pro tools
  const { runner } = await AgentBuilder.create("crypto_analyst_agent")
    .withModel("gemini-2.5-flash")
    .withDescription(
      "A professional cryptocurrency analyst with access to real-time market data"
    )
    .withTools(...coinGeckoTools)
    .build();

  try {
    // Example queries
    const priceAnalysis = await runner.ask(
      "What's the current price of Bitcoin and Ethereum? Compare their 24h price changes."
    );
    console.log(priceAnalysis);

    const marketCap = await runner.ask(
      "Show me the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap"
    );
    console.log(marketCap);

    const trendingCoins = await runner.ask(
      "What are the trending cryptocurrencies today?"
    );
    console.log(trendingCoins);

    const defiAnalysis = await runner.ask(
      "Analyze the current DeFi market trends and identify top Protocols"
    );
    console.log(defiAnalysis);
  } finally {
    // Clean up resources
    await toolset.close();
  }
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

## Environment Variables

Configure the following environment variables to use MCP CoinGecko Pro:

| Variable                | Required | Description                                          |
| ----------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `COINGECKO_PRO_API_KEY` | Yes      | Your CoinGecko Pro API key for authenticated access  |
| `PATH`                  | No       | System PATH (automatically included if not provided) |
| `DEBUG`                 | No       | Enable debug logging for troubleshooting             |

**Getting Your API Key:**

To obtain a CoinGecko Pro API key:

1. Visit [CoinGecko API Plans](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/pricing)
2. Choose a Pro plan that fits your needs
3. Sign up and obtain your API key from the dashboard
4. Add the key to your environment variables

## Best Practices

- **Rate Limit Management**: Configure retry options with appropriate delays to handle rate limiting gracefully
- **Resource Cleanup**: Always call `await toolset.close()` when done to properly close connections
- **Caching**: Implement caching for frequently accessed data to reduce API calls and stay within rate limits
- **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle different error scenarios. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for rate limit errors.
- **API Key Security**: Store your API key in environment variables, never hardcode it in your source code

## Troubleshooting

**API Key Not Working**

- Verify your API key is correctly set in environment variables
- Ensure the key is from a valid Pro subscription
- Check that the key hasn't expired

**Connection Timeout**

- Check your internet connection
- Verify CoinGecko API status at [status.coingecko.com](https://status.coingecko.com/)
- Increase retry delay in `retryOptions` configuration

**Tool Not Found or Invalid Schema**

- Call `await toolset.getTools()` to refresh and get the latest tool schemas
- Check the [CoinGecko API Documentation](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation) for API changes
