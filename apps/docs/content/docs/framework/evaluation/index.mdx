Agent evaluation provides systematic approaches to testing and validating agent performance, moving beyond prototype to production-ready AI systems.

<Callout type="info" title="Coming Soon">
The comprehensive evaluation framework is being actively developed for `@iqai/adk`. Core evaluation classes and automated testing tools will be available in upcoming releases.
</Callout>

## Overview

Unlike traditional software testing, agent evaluation must account for the probabilistic nature of LLM responses and the complexity of multi-step reasoning processes. Effective evaluation encompasses multiple dimensions from tool usage patterns to response quality.

## Current Capabilities

While the full evaluation framework is in development, you can currently:

- **Manual Testing**: Use the examples to test agent behavior manually
- **Session Analysis**: Review agent interactions through session management
- **Response Validation**: Manually verify agent outputs and tool usage
- **Performance Observation**: Monitor agent behavior through logging and events

## Coming Features

The upcoming evaluation framework will include:

- **AgentEvaluator**: Comprehensive agent performance assessment
- **TrajectoryEvaluator**: Tool usage and decision path analysis
- **ResponseEvaluator**: Output quality and semantic similarity scoring
- **EvalSet Management**: Batch evaluation of complex scenarios
- **Automated Test Runners**: Continuous integration with development workflows
- **Performance Analytics**: Trend analysis and regression detection

## Getting Started

For immediate testing needs:

1. **Review Examples**: Explore the [examples directory](https://github.com/iqai/adk-ts/tree/main/apps/examples) for agent testing patterns
2. **Session Monitoring**: Use session services to track agent interactions
3. **Manual Validation**: Create custom test scripts using the Runner class
4. **Event Analysis**: Monitor agent events for behavior analysis
