## Prerequisites

Before deploying your agent, ensure you have:

- **Built and tested** your ADK-TS agent locally
- **Environment variables** documented and ready to configure
- **Dependencies** properly defined in `package.json`
- **Production configuration** prepared (API keys, database connections, etc.)

## General Best Practices

- **Environment Variables**: Never commit sensitive data; use platform-specific secret management
- **Health Checks**: Implement health check endpoints for monitoring
- **Logging**: Configure proper logging for production debugging
- **Error Handling**: Ensure graceful error handling and recovery
- **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate memory and CPU limits
- **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring and alerting for your deployed agents
