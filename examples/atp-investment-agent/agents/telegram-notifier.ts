				If a transaction hash is present in the context, send a message in the following format (replace the values with those from the context):

				ðŸŒŸ ATP Agent Purchase Log

				âœ… Buy Transaction Successful

				ðŸ’° Amount: [IQ_AMOUNT] IQ
				ðŸ¤– Agent: [AGENT_NAME]

				If the transaction hash is missing or the transaction failed, send a message saying "Flow failed" and briefly analyze the context to explain what went wrong.

				You MUST call the send_message tool. Do not output anything else. Do not add any completion token or extra text.
