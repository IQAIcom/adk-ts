## What is a Tool?

A **Tool** in ADK-TS is a specialized component that extends an AI agent's capabilities beyond text generation. Tools enable agents to perform concrete actions like retrieving data from APIs, accessing databases, or interacting with external systems.

In technical terms, a tool in ADK-TS is an implementation of the `BaseTool` class or a function that can be converted into a tool. Each tool has a name, description, and a function that executes when called by an agent. Tools receive structured input arguments and return structured data that the agent can use for further reasoning.

### Core Principles

**Focused Functionality**: Each tool should have a single, well-defined purpose. Rather than creating one complex tool that does everything, build multiple focused tools that each excel at specific tasks—fetching user profiles, sending notifications, processing payments, etc.

**Structured Data Exchange**: Tools communicate with agents using defined schema. They accept structured inputs validated against TypeScript types or Zod schemas, and return structured data that agents can process predictably.

**Deterministic Execution**: Tools execute the exact logic you define. When an agent calls a tool, it runs your implementation with the provided arguments, returning consistent results for the same inputs. The agent decides when to call the tool, but the tool itself performs predictably.

**Seamless Integration**: Tools integrate directly into the agent's reasoning process. The agent can examine tool outputs, make decisions based on results, and chain multiple tools together to accomplish complex workflows.

<Callout type="info" title="Division of Responsibilities">
  Your agent handles the "thinking"—understanding user intent, deciding which
  tools to use, and interpreting results. Your tools handle the
  "doing"—executing specific operations and returning structured data for the
  agent to work with.
</Callout>

## How Agents Work with Tools

The interaction between agents and tools follows a natural cycle that mirrors how humans might work with specialized assistants:

1. **Understanding**: Your agent processes the user's request and determines what actions might be needed to fulfill it. It considers the available tools and their documented capabilities.

2. **Decision Making**: The agent chooses which tool to use based on the situation. This choice is guided by each tool's name, description, and the current context of the conversation.

3. **Execution**: The agent calls the selected tool with appropriate parameters, automatically validating inputs against your TypeScript definitions. The tool runs your custom logic and returns results.

4. **Processing**: The agent receives the tool's response and incorporates it into its understanding. It can then decide to call additional tools, process the data further, or respond to the user.

5. **Response**: Finally, the agent uses all gathered information to provide a comprehensive answer or take the next appropriate action.

## Types of Tools Available

ADK-TS provides several approaches for creating and integrating tools, each suited to different development scenarios:

**[Function Tools](/docs/framework/tools/function-tools)**: Wrap TypeScript functions as tools by extracting metadata from JSDoc comments and function signatures. Useful when you want to turn existing functions into agent tools with minimal changes.

**[createTool](/docs/framework/tools/create-tool)**: A streamlined utility that converts TypeScript functions into tools using explicit Zod schemas. Offers automatic schema generation and better error handling. This is the recommended approach for new tool development.

**[Built-in Tools](/docs/framework/tools/built-in-tools)**: Ready-to-use tools provided by ADK-TS for common operations like search, file manipulation, and user interactions.

**[MCP Tools](/docs/framework/tools/mcp-tools)**: Connect to external systems using the Model Context Protocol standard. Ideal for integrating with third-party services that support MCP.

**[Third-Party Tools](/docs/framework/tools/third-party-tools)**: Integrate existing npm packages and JavaScript libraries as tools for your agents.

**[OpenAPI Tools](/docs/framework/tools/openapi-tools)**: Automatically generate tools from OpenAPI/Swagger specifications to interact with REST APIs.

**[Google Cloud Tools](/docs/framework/tools/google-cloud-tools)**: Specialized tools for Google Cloud Platform services, with built-in authentication and service integration.

**[Authentication](/docs/framework/tools/authentication)**: Learn how to implement authentication flows for tools that access protected APIs and services.

## Guiding Tool Usage in Agent Instructions

When configuring your [agents](/docs/framework/agents), you'll want to provide clear guidance on how and when to use each tool. The key is focusing on the **context and conditions** for tool usage rather than repeating what the tool does (which should be clear from its name and description).

**Focus on Decision Logic**: Tell your agent when to use each tool based on user requests, conversation context, or specific conditions. For example: "Use `searchDocuments` when the user asks about policies or procedures that aren't in your training data."

**Handle Different Outcomes**: Always specify how the agent should respond to different tool results. If `validateUser` returns an error, should the agent ask for different credentials, escalate to human support, or try a different approach?

**Chain Tools Effectively**: When tools work together in sequence, describe the expected workflow clearly. This helps the agent understand dependencies and handle intermediate failures gracefully.

## Example: Building a Customer Support Agent

Let's build a practical customer support agent that demonstrates how multiple tools work together to handle real user requests:

```typescript
import { createTool, LlmAgent } from "@iqai/adk";
import { z } from "zod";

// Tool 1: Look up customer account information
const lookupCustomer = createTool({
  name: "lookupCustomer",
  description: "Looks up a customer profile by ID",
  schema: z.object({
    customerId: z.string().describe("Customer identifier (usually email)"),
  }),
  fn: async ({ customerId }) => {
    // Simulate database lookup
    const customerDb = {
      "john@example.com": {
        name: "John Smith",
        tier: "premium",
        status: "active",
        lastLogin: "2024-12-10",
      },
      "jane@example.com": {
        name: "Jane Doe",
        tier: "basic",
        status: "suspended",
        lastLogin: "2024-11-15",
      },
    };

    const customer = customerDb[customerId];
    if (customer) {
      return {
        status: "found",
        customer,
        canAssist: customer.status === "active",
      };
    }

    return { status: "not_found", message: "Customer not found in system" };
  },
});

// Tool 2: Create a support ticket
const createTicket = createTool({
  name: "createTicket",
  description: "Creates a new support ticket for tracking issues",
  schema: z.object({
    customerId: z.string().describe("Customer identifier"),
    category: z
      .enum(["technical", "billing", "account", "general"])
      .describe("Issue category"),
    priority: z
      .enum(["low", "medium", "high", "urgent"])
      .describe("Ticket priority level"),
    description: z.string().describe("Detailed issue description"),
  }),
  fn: async ({ customerId, category, priority, description }) => {
    // Generate ticket ID and simulate creation
    const ticketId = `TK-${Date.now().toString().slice(-6)}`;

    return {
      status: "created",
      ticketId,
      estimatedResponse: priority === "urgent" ? "1 hour" : "24 hours",
      category,
      assignedTeam:
        category === "technical" ? "Engineering" : "General Support",
    };
  },
});

// Create customer support agent with workflow instructions
const supportAgent = new LlmAgent({
  name: "customerSupportAgent",
  model: "gemini-2.0-flash-exp",
  instruction: `You are a customer support specialist. Follow this workflow:

**Customer Identification:**
- Always start by getting the customer's information using 'lookupCustomer'
- If customer is not found, politely ask them to verify their details
- If customer account is suspended, explain the status and guide them to resolution

**Issue Resolution:**
- For active customers, listen to their issue and determine if you can resolve it immediately
- For complex technical issues or account changes, use 'createTicket' with appropriate priority
- Set priority to 'urgent' for service outages, 'high' for billing issues affecting service
- Always explain next steps and provide ticket numbers when created

**Communication Style:**
- Be helpful and professional
- Acknowledge premium customers appropriately  
- Provide realistic timeframes for resolution`,

  tools: [lookupCustomer, createTicket],
});
```

**Key Implementation Patterns:**

- **Structured Workflows**: The agent follows a clear customer identification → issue assessment → resolution path
- **Conditional Logic**: Different responses based on customer tier and account status
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling when customer information isn't found
- **Business Rules**: Priority assignment based on issue type and customer tier

## Working with ToolContext

When you need your tools to access additional information or interact with services, ADK-TS provides the `ToolContext` class. This context is automatically injected as the second parameter to your tool function when using the `createTool` utility or extending the `BaseTool` class.

<Callout type="info" title="Hidden from Agent">
  The `toolContext` parameter is invisible to your agent—don't include it in
  tool descriptions. The agent only sees and provides the business parameters
  your tool needs to do its job.
</Callout>

### ToolContext Capabilities

The `ToolContext` class extends `CallbackContext` and provides access to these capabilities for your tools:

**Function Call Identification**
: Access the `functionCallId` to identify and track the specific tool call. This is useful for logging, debugging, or mapping responses back to original requests. This ID is assigned by the agent system to uniquely identify each tool invocation.

**Event Actions**
: Access agent flow control through `toolContext.actions`. This allows tools to influence how the agent processes results and routes execution. See the Event Actions Example section below for usage details.

**Artifact Management**
: List files and artifacts attached to the current session using `listArtifacts()`. This is useful when you need to access user-uploaded files or generated documents during tool execution.

**Memory Access**
: Search the user's long-term memory with `searchMemory(query)`. This allows tools to retrieve relevant information from previous conversations or stored data, enabling context-aware tool behavior.

### Memory Access Example

Here's an example of a tool that accesses the user's memory:

```typescript
import { createTool, ToolContext } from "@iqai/adk";
import { z } from "zod";

const searchUserHistory = createTool({
  name: "searchUserHistory",
  description:
    "Searches the user's conversation history for relevant information",
  schema: z.object({
    query: z.string().describe("The search query to find relevant history"),
  }),
  fn: async ({ query }, toolContext: ToolContext) => {
    try {
      // Use the memory service to search for relevant information
      const results = await toolContext.searchMemory(query);

      return {
        status: "success",
        results: results.items,
        count: results.items.length,
      };
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Failed to search memory:", error);
      return {
        status: "error",
        message: `Could not search user history: ${error.message}`,
      };
    }
  },
});
```

### Artifact Access Example

Tools can access artifacts (files and documents) stored in the session:

```typescript
import { createTool, ToolContext } from "@iqai/adk";
import { z } from "zod";

const processUploadedFile = createTool({
  name: "processUploadedFile",
  description: "Processes and analyzes an uploaded file",
  schema: z.object({
    filename: z.string().describe("Name of the file to process"),
    analysisType: z
      .enum(["summary", "extract", "transform"])
      .describe("Type of analysis to perform"),
  }),
  fn: async ({ filename, analysisType }, toolContext: ToolContext) => {
    try {
      // List available artifacts in the session
      const artifacts = await toolContext.listArtifacts();

      if (!artifacts.includes(filename)) {
        return {
          status: "error",
          message: `File "${filename}" not found in session`,
        };
      }

      // Process the file based on analysis type
      return {
        status: "success",
        filename: filename,
        analysisType: analysisType,
        processed: true,
      };
    } catch (error) {
      return {
        status: "error",
        message: `Failed to process file: ${error.message}`,
      };
    }
  },
});
```

### Event Actions Example

Control agent flow using event actions. ToolContext provides access to event actions that can influence how the agent processes results:

```typescript
import { createTool, ToolContext } from "@iqai/adk";
import { z } from "zod";

const validateAndRoute = createTool({
  name: "validateAndRoute",
  description: "Validates user input and routes to appropriate handler",
  schema: z.object({
    userInput: z.string().describe("The user input to validate"),
  }),
  fn: async ({ userInput }, toolContext: ToolContext) => {
    // Analyze the input
    const isComplex = userInput.length > 500;
    const requiresEscalation =
      userInput.toLowerCase().includes("urgent") ||
      userInput.toLowerCase().includes("emergency");

    if (requiresEscalation) {
      // Use event actions to signal escalation needs
      // (Implementation details depend on your agent's configuration)
      toolContext.actions.transferToAgent = "escalation_specialist";

      return {
        status: "escalating",
        message: "This request requires escalation to a specialist.",
      };
    }

    return {
      status: "routed",
      complexity: isComplex ? "high" : "normal",
      ready: true,
    };
  },
});
```

<Callout type="info" title="Advanced Flow Control">
  Event actions like `transferToAgent` are part of ADK's advanced flow control
  system. For complete details about how the agent system handles flow control
  and routing, see the [Agents](/docs/framework/agents) documentation.
</Callout>

## Integrating Tools with Agents

There are multiple ways to integrate tools with your agents in ADK-TS. Choose the approach that best fits your needs.

### Using LlmAgent

To use tools with your agent, add them to the agent's configuration by passing an array of tools to the `tools` property of the `LlmAgent` constructor:

```typescript
import { LlmAgent } from "@iqai/adk";
import { weatherTool, timeTool, calculatorTool } from "./my-tools";

const agent = new LlmAgent({
  name: "assistantAgent",
  description: "A helpful assistant",
  instruction: `You are a helpful assistant. Use the provided tools when needed to answer user questions.`,
  tools: [weatherTool, timeTool, calculatorTool],
});
```

The agent will automatically have access to these tools and can use them when responding to user queries. The agent uses the tool's name and description to determine when to use it, and it passes the appropriate arguments based on the tool's schema.

### Using AgentBuilder

If you're using the `AgentBuilder` pattern, you can add tools using the `withTools()` method:

```typescript
import { AgentBuilder } from "@iqai/adk";
import { weatherTool, timeTool, calculatorTool } from "./my-tools";

const agent = new AgentBuilder({
  name: "assistantAgent",
  description: "A helpful assistant",
})
  .instruction(
    `You are a helpful assistant. Use the provided tools when needed to answer user questions.`
  )
  .withTools([weatherTool, timeTool, calculatorTool])
  .build();
```

The `withTools()` method accepts the same array of tools and integrates them into the agent's configuration. You can call `withTools()` multiple times to add different groups of tools:

```typescript
const agent = new AgentBuilder({
  name: "complexAgent",
  description: "An agent with multiple tool categories",
})
  .instruction(
    `You are a complex agent with access to multiple tool categories.`
  )
  .withTools([databaseTools, ...analyticsTools])
  .withTools([searchTools])
  .build();
```

### Adding Tools Dynamically

Both approaches allow you to manage tools programmatically. You can conditionally add tools based on configuration or user permissions:

```typescript
import { LlmAgent } from "@iqai/adk";

const tools = [];

if (config.enableSearch) {
  tools.push(searchTool);
}

if (userRole === "admin") {
  tools.push(systemAdminTool);
}

if (config.enableAnalytics) {
  tools.push(...analyticsTool);
}

const agent = new LlmAgent({
  name: "dynamicAgent",
  description: "Agent with dynamic tool configuration",
  instruction: `You have access to various tools based on your permissions.`,
  tools: tools,
});
```

## Tool Creation Approaches

There are two ways to create tools in ADK-TS:

### 1. Using the `createTool` utility:

This is the recommended approach for most use cases. It provides a clean syntax with Zod schema validation:

```typescript
import { createTool } from "@iqai/adk";
import { z } from "zod";

const weatherTool = createTool({
  name: "getWeather",
  description: "Gets the current weather for a location",
  schema: z.object({
    location: z.string().describe("The city and country/state"),
    unit: z.enum(["celsius", "fahrenheit"]).optional().default("celsius"),
  }),
  fn: async ({ location, unit }, toolContext) => {
    // Tool implementation
    // ...
    return {
      temperature: 22,
      conditions: "Sunny",
      location: location,
      unit: unit,
    };
  },
});
```

### 2. Extending the `BaseTool` class:

For more complex tools that need additional customization, you can extend the `BaseTool` class:

```typescript
import { BaseTool } from "@iqai/adk";
import type { ToolContext } from "@iqai/adk";

class CustomWeatherTool extends BaseTool {
  constructor() {
    super({
      name: "customWeather",
      description: "Gets weather with additional features",
      isLongRunning: false,
    });
  }

  // This is the method that's called when the tool is invoked
  async runAsync(args: any, context: ToolContext): Promise<any> {
    // Custom implementation
    // ...
    return {
      /* result */
    };
  }

  // Provide the function declaration for the LLM
  getDeclaration() {
    return {
      name: this.name,
      description: this.description,
      parameters: {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
          location: {
            type: "string",
            description: "The city and country/state",
          },
          unit: {
            type: "string",
            enum: ["celsius", "fahrenheit"],
            default: "celsius",
          },
        },
        required: ["location"],
      },
    };
  }
}
```

More detailed information about creating tools can be found in the [Function Tools](/docs/framework/tools/function-tools) and [createTool](/docs/framework/tools/create-tool) documentation.

## Best Practices for Tool Design

Creating effective tools for AI agents requires careful design. Here are some best practices:

### 1. Use Clear Names and Descriptions

Tools should have intuitive names that clearly indicate their purpose. The description should explain what the tool does, when to use it, and any important constraints:

```typescript
const userLookupTool = createTool({
  name: "getUserProfile", // Clear action-oriented name
  description:
    "Retrieves a user's profile information by username or email. Use this when you need to access user data for verification or personalization.",
  // ...
});
```

### 2. Validate Inputs Properly

Use Zod schemas to clearly define and validate the expected inputs:

```typescript
const scheduleTool = createTool({
  // ...
  schema: z.object({
    date: z.string().describe("Date in YYYY-MM-DD format"),
    startTime: z
      .string()
      .regex(/^([01]\d|2[0-3]):([0-5]\d)$/)
      .describe("Start time in 24-hour format (HH:MM)"),
    duration: z
      .number()
      .min(15)
      .max(120)
      .describe("Meeting duration in minutes"),
  }),
  // ...
});
```

### 3. Return Structured Results

Return consistent object structures that make it easy for the agent to understand the result:

```typescript
fn: async ({ query }) => {
  try {
    const results = await searchDatabase(query);
    return {
      status: "success",
      results: results,
      count: results.length,
    };
  } catch (error) {
    return {
      status: "error",
      message: error.message,
    };
  }
};
```

### 4. Handle Errors Gracefully

Always handle potential errors and return informative error messages:

```typescript
fn: async ({ userId }) => {
  try {
    const user = await getUserById(userId);

    if (!user) {
      return {
        status: "not_found",
        message: `No user found with ID: ${userId}`,
      };
    }

    return {
      status: "success",
      user: user,
    };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error fetching user ${userId}:`, error);
    return {
      status: "error",
      message: "Failed to retrieve user data. Please try again.",
    };
  }
};
```

## Organizing Tools in Your Application

As your application grows, you might create many tools. Here are some strategies for organizing them effectively:

### Group Tools by Domain

Organize tools into related groups based on their functionality:

```typescript
// File: tools/database-tools.ts
export const getUserTool = createTool({
  /*...*/
});
export const createUserTool = createTool({
  /*...*/
});
export const updateUserTool = createTool({
  /*...*/
});

// File: tools/analytics-tools.ts
export const generateReportTool = createTool({
  /*...*/
});
export const trackEventTool = createTool({
  /*...*/
});

// File: agent.ts
import { LlmAgent } from "@iqai/adk";
import * as dbTools from "./tools/database-tools";
import * as analyticsTools from "./tools/analytics-tools";

const agent = new LlmAgent({
  // ...
  tools: [...Object.values(dbTools), ...Object.values(analyticsTools)],
});
```

### Create Tool Libraries

For complex applications, you can create reusable tool libraries that can be shared across agents:

```typescript
// File: tools/index.ts
import { BaseTool } from "@iqai/adk";

export function createToolset(config: ToolsetConfig): BaseTool[] {
  const tools: BaseTool[] = [];

  if (config.includeDatabase) {
    tools.push(getUserTool, createUserTool);
  }

  if (config.includeAnalytics) {
    tools.push(generateReportTool);
  }

  return tools;
}
```
