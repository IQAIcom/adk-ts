ADK-TS provides first-class observability support through comprehensive OpenTelemetry integration. Monitor your agents' performance, trace execution flows, collect metrics, and gain insights into LLM interactions, tool usage, and agent behavior.

## Overview

The observability system in ADK-TS is built on OpenTelemetry, providing:

- **Distributed Tracing** - Track agent invocations, tool executions, and LLM calls across your system
- **Metrics Collection** - Monitor performance with counters, histograms, and token usage tracking
- **Auto-Instrumentation** - Automatic tracing of HTTP calls, database queries, and file operations
- **Privacy Controls** - Configurable content capture for production environments
- **Platform Integration** - Works with Jaeger, Grafana, Datadog, New Relic, Honeycomb, and more

<Callout type="info" title="Built-in Support">
  All telemetry dependencies are included in `@iqai/adk`. No additional installation required.
</Callout>

## Key Features

### Distributed Tracing

Track the complete lifecycle of agent operations:

- **Agent Invocations** - Full execution traces with session and user context
- **Tool Executions** - Arguments, responses, and execution duration
- **LLM Calls** - Model parameters, token usage, and request/response content
- **Context Propagation** - Trace correlation across async operations

### Metrics Collection

Comprehensive metrics for monitoring:

- **Counters** - Agent invocations, tool executions, LLM calls, errors
- **Histograms** - Duration tracking for agents, tools, and LLM calls
- **Token Tracking** - Input, output, and total token usage per LLM call
- **Error Metrics** - Detailed error context and categorization

### Privacy & Security

Production-ready privacy controls:

- **Content Capture Control** - Disable sensitive data capture via environment variable or config
- **Selective Filtering** - Metadata captured even when content is disabled
- **Environment-Based Configuration** - Different settings for dev, staging, and production

### Auto-Instrumentation

Automatic tracing of common operations:

- HTTP/HTTPS requests
- Database queries
- File system operations
- DNS lookups

## Quick Example

```typescript
import { telemetryService } from '@iqai/adk';

// Initialize telemetry
await telemetryService.initialize({
  appName: 'my-agent-app',
  appVersion: '1.0.0',
  otlpEndpoint: 'http://localhost:4318/v1/traces',
  enableMetrics: true,
  enableTracing: true,
});

// Your agents automatically send traces and metrics
const agent = AgentBuilder.withModel('gemini-2.5-flash').build();
const response = await agent.ask('Hello!');
```

## Architecture

The observability system follows a modular architecture:

```
Application
    ↓
TelemetryService
    ├─ Setup Service
    ├─ Tracing Service
    ├─ Metrics Service
    └─ Utilities
    ↓
OpenTelemetry SDK
    ├─ TracerProvider
    └─ MeterProvider
    ↓
OTLP Exporters
    ├─ Trace Exporter
    └─ Metric Exporter
    ↓
Backend (Jaeger, Tempo, etc.)
```

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Getting Started** - Learn how to initialize and configure telemetry
2. **Explore Tracing** - Understand what gets traced and how to view traces
3. **Set Up Metrics** - Monitor your agents' performance
4. **Configure for Production** - Ensure privacy and optimal performance
5. **Integrate with Your Platform** - Connect to your observability backend
