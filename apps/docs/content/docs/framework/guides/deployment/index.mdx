## Prerequisites

Before deploying your agent, ensure you have:

- **Built and tested** your ADK-TS agent locally
- **Environment variables** documented and ready to configure
- **Dependencies** properly defined in `package.json`
- **Production configuration** prepared (API keys, database connections, etc.)

## General Best Practices

To ensure a stable and secure production environment, follow these best practices:

- **Environment Variables**: Use platform-specific secret management (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Vercel/Railway Environment Variables). Never commit `.env` files or sensitive data to version control.
- **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate memory and CPU limits to prevent resource exhaustion and manage costs.
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Configure production-grade logging and monitoring. Regularly review logs to catch errors and performance issues early.
- **Security**: Use IAM roles or service accounts instead of long-lived access keys. Implement the principle of least privilege for all permissions.
- **Version Control**: Use specific tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`) or git commit SHAs for Docker images and deployments instead of `latest` to ensure reproducible builds.
- **Health Checks**: If your agent exposes an HTTP endpoint, implement health check routes to allow platform-level monitoring and automatic restarts.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

If you encounter issues during deployment, check these common points before diving into platform-specific configurations:

- **Missing Variables**: The most common cause of startup failure. Verify all required environment variables are set in your platform dashboard (case-sensitive).
- **Architecture Mismatch**: If using Docker, ensure you are building for the target architecture (usually `linux/amd64`) via `docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64`.
- **Timeouts**: AI processing can take longer than standard API requests. Check your platform's serverless or load balancer timeout settings (e.g., Lambda's 15m limit or Vercel's `maxDuration`).
- **Build Failures**: Review build logs carefully for missing dependencies, TypeScript compilation errors, or syntax issues in your `Dockerfile`.
- **Runtime Errors**: Check your service logs for stack traces. Ensure your compiled code (usually in `dist/`) is being correctly referenced in the start command.
