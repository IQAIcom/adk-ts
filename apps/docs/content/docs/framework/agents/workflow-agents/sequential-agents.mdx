Sequential agents create powerful pipelines where agents execute in a specific order, with each step building on the results of the previous one. Think assembly line for AI - each agent specializes in one part of the process, and the final result is the combined output of all steps working together.

Perfect for workflows where order matters: research before analysis, writing before editing, data collection before processing. Unlike [parallel agents](/docs/framework/agents/workflow-agents/parallel-agents) that run simultaneously, sequential agents guarantee execution order and enable sophisticated multi-step reasoning.

<Callout type="info" title="When Order Matters">
  Use sequential agents when each step depends on the previous one's output. The
  magic happens when agents pass enriched context down the pipeline, creating
  more sophisticated results than any single agent could achieve.
</Callout>

## Quick Start Example

Here's a market research pipeline that transforms a simple query into comprehensive business intelligence:

```typescript
import * as dotenv from "dotenv";
import { LlmAgent, SequentialAgent, AgentBuilder } from "@iqai/adk";

dotenv.config();

// Step 1: Gather raw data using web search
const researchAgent = new LlmAgent({
  name: "research_agent",
  description: "Researches companies and topics to gather market intelligence",
  instruction: `Research the given company/topic. Focus on current market position, competitors, recent news, and financial performance.`,
});

// Step 2: Analyze the collected data
const analysisAgent = new LlmAgent({
  name: "analysis_agent",
  description: "Analyzes research data to identify opportunities and threats",
  instruction: `Analyze the research data. Identify key opportunities, threats, market trends, and competitive advantages.`,
});

// Step 3: Create actionable recommendations
const strategistAgent = new LlmAgent({
  name: "strategist_agent",
  description: "Creates strategic recommendations based on analysis",
  instruction: `Based on the research and analysis, create 3-5 specific actionable strategies with risk assessment and timeline. Format as an executive summary.`,
});

// Sequential pipeline: research → analyze → strategize
const marketIntelligencePipeline = new SequentialAgent({
  name: "market_intelligence_pipeline",
  description: "Comprehensive market analysis and strategy development",
  subAgents: [researchAgent, analysisAgent, strategistAgent],
});

const rootAgent = () => {
  return AgentBuilder.create("root_agent")
    .withModel("gemini-2.5-flash")
    .withDescription("Comprehensive market analysis and strategy development")
    .withSubAgents([marketIntelligencePipeline])
    .build();
};

async function main() {
  const { runner } = await rootAgent();

  const response = await runner.ask(
    "Analyze Tesla's position in the EV market and suggest growth strategies"
  );
  console.log("📝 Final Response:\n");
  console.log(response);
}
main().catch(console.error);
```

## How Sequential Processing Works

Sequential agents create a data pipeline where information gets progressively enriched at each step:

**🔄 Execution Flow**

1. **Agent 1** receives the original input and processes it
2. **Agent 2** gets both the original input AND Agent 1's output
3. **Agent 3** receives original input + Agent 1's output + Agent 2's output
4. This continues for each agent in the sequence

**💡 Context Accumulation**  
Each agent sees the full conversation history, so later agents can reference and build upon earlier agents' work. This creates sophisticated reasoning chains that single agents can't achieve.

**🎯 Deterministic Order**  
Execution order is guaranteed - no race conditions or unpredictable results. Perfect for production workflows where consistency matters.

<Callout type="info" title="Data Flow Between Agents">
  Agents automatically share session state, so later agents can reference
  earlier results. Use descriptive output and clear instructions to help agents
  understand what information to pass forward.
</Callout>

## Real-World Use Cases

**📊 Business Intelligence Pipeline**  
Research → Analysis → Strategic Recommendations → Executive Summary

**📝 Content Creation Workflow**  
Draft → Fact-check → Edit → Style Review → Final Polish

**🔍 Technical Documentation**  
Code Analysis → Documentation Draft → Technical Review → User Testing → Publication

**⚖️ Legal Document Review**  
Initial Review → Compliance Check → Risk Assessment → Final Approval

**🧪 Scientific Analysis**  
Data Collection → Statistical Analysis → Peer Review → Conclusion Generation

## When to Choose Sequential Agents

<Callout type="success" title="Perfect For Sequential Processing">
  - **Use when:** Each step builds on the previous one's output
  - **Benefit:** Creates sophisticated reasoning chains impossible with single agents
</Callout>

### ✅ Choose Sequential When:

- **Dependencies matter** - Later steps need earlier results
- **Quality control** - Each stage validates and improves the work
- **Specialization** - Different expertise needed at each step
- **Compliance** - Regulated workflows requiring specific order
- **Complex reasoning** - Multi-step analysis and decision making

### ❌ Don't Use Sequential When:

- Tasks are completely independent
- Speed is more important than thoroughness
- You need real-time parallel processing
- Simple, single-step operations
