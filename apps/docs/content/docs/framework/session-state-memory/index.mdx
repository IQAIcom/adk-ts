ADK-TS provides a three-tier architecture for managing conversation data: **Sessions** for active conversation threads, **State** for dynamic conversation data, and **Memory** for long-term knowledge retrieval. Each layer serves a distinct purpose and can be customized to match your deployment requirements.

## What is Session?

A Session represents an individual conversation thread, similar to a chat thread in messaging apps. Each session contains:

- **Message History**: Chronological record of all interactions (events)
- **State**: Dynamic data specific to the conversation
- **Metadata**: Identification, timestamps, and tracking information

Sessions ensure your agents maintain context across multiple turns, enabling natural, coherent conversations.

## What is State?

State is the agent's scratchpad for storing and updating information during a conversation. It supports:

- **Scoped Storage**: Session-level, user-level, and app-level data
- **Dynamic Updates**: Change state throughout the conversation
- **Persistence**: Automatic saving based on your session service
- **Templating**: Inject state values directly into agent instructions

State enables agents to remember user preferences, track multi-step workflows, and provide personalized experiences.

## What is Memory?

Memory provides long-term knowledge storage that persists across conversations. It enables:

- **Cross-Conversation Recall**: Remember information from past interactions
- **Semantic Search**: Find relevant knowledge using natural language queries
- **Knowledge Integration**: Access external knowledge bases and documentation

While sessions handle short-term conversation context, memory provides the long-term knowledge your agents need to learn and improve over time.

## Session Services

ADK-TS provides multiple session service implementations for different use cases:

- **In-Memory**: Fast and simple for development and testing. Data is lost on restart.
- **Database** (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite): Production-ready persistence with full SQL support.
- **Vertex AI**: Enterprise Google Cloud-managed sessions with automatic scaling and backups.

Each implementation provides the same API, making them interchangeable. Choose based on your deployment needs.

### Choosing Your Stack

With sessions and memory, you can mix and match implementations based on your needs:

| Use Case                 | Session Service        | Memory Service           |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Local Development        | InMemorySessionService | InMemoryMemoryService    |
| Production (Self-hosted) | DatabaseSessionService | Custom or Vertex AI RAG  |
| Production (Cloud)       | VertexAiSessionService | VertexAiRagMemoryService |
| Testing                  | InMemorySessionService | InMemoryMemoryService    |
