Workflow agents orchestrate multiple agents to solve complex problems that require coordination, parallel processing, or iterative refinement. Think of them as the conductors of your agent orchestra - they don't generate content themselves, but control how and when other agents execute.

Unlike [LLM Agents](/docs/framework/agents/llm-agents) that use language models for reasoning, workflow agents operate with deterministic logic to ensure predictable, reliable execution patterns. This makes them perfect for building robust multi-step processes where you need guaranteed execution order and consistent results.

<Callout type="info" title="Workflow vs LLM Agents">
  - **Workflow Agents** manage execution flow with predictable patterns
  (sequential → parallel → loop → LangGraph).
  - **LLM Agents** use language
  models for dynamic reasoning and content generation.
  - **Best together:** Use
  workflow agents to orchestrate LLM agents for complex, multi-step processes.

## Key Benefits

Workflow agents solve real problems that single agents can't handle effectively:

**🔄 Reliable Process Control**  
Guarantee execution order and patterns without relying on LLM decision-making. Perfect for production workflows where consistency matters.

**⚡ Performance Optimization**  
Run independent tasks in parallel or iterate until quality standards are met. Scale processing power where it's needed most.

**🧩 Composable Complexity**  
Break complex problems into manageable steps. Each sub-agent can focus on what it does best while the workflow manages coordination.

**🎯 Specialized Orchestration**  
Combine different agent types - use LLM agents for reasoning, tool agents for actions, and workflow agents for coordination.

## Quick Start Example

Here's a content creation pipeline using AgentBuilder with sequential workflow:

```typescript
import * as dotenv from "dotenv";
import { LlmAgent, SequentialAgent, AgentBuilder } from "@iqai/adk";

dotenv.config();

// Create specialized agents for each step
const writerAgent = new LlmAgent({
  name: "content_writer_agent",
  model: "gpt-4o-mini",
  description: "Creates engaging and informative articles on given topics",
  instruction: `Write a comprehensive, engaging article on the given topic. 
  Include an introduction, main points with examples, and a conclusion.`,
});

const editorAgent = new LlmAgent({
  name: "copy_editor_agent",
  model: "gpt-4o-mini",
  description: "Edits content for clarity, grammar, and style",
  instruction: `Review and edit the article for clarity, grammar, and style. 
  Improve readability while maintaining the original voice and message.`,
});

const factCheckerAgent = new LlmAgent({
  name: "fact_checker_agent",
  model: "gpt-4o-mini",
  description: "Verifies claims and identifies statements requiring sources",
  instruction: `Verify factual claims using web search. Flag any unsupported 
  statements and add citations where needed.`,
});


// Sequential pipeline: Write → Edit → Fact-check
const contentCreationAgent = () => {
  return AgentBuilder.create("content_creation_pipeline")
    .withModel("gpt-4o-mini")
    .withDescription("End-to-end content creation with quality controls")
    .asSequential([writerAgent, editorAgent, factCheckerAgent])
    .build();
};

async function main() {
  const { runner } = await contentCreationAgent();
  const response = await runner.ask(
    "Write an article about the benefits of renewable energy"
  );

  console.log("📝 Final Response:\n");
  console.log(response);
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

## Choosing the Right Workflow Type

Each workflow type solves different coordination challenges:

### Sequential Agents

**When to use:** Steps must happen in order, each building on the previous result  
**Perfect for:** Content pipelines, data processing chains, quality assurance workflows  
**Example:** Research → Analysis → Report → Review

### Parallel Agents

**When to use:** Tasks are independent and can run simultaneously  
**Perfect for:** Multi-perspective analysis, concurrent data processing, distributed tasks  
**Example:** Sentiment analysis + Topic extraction + Summary generation

### Loop Agents

**When to use:** Need iterative refinement or retry logic until conditions are met  
**Perfect for:** Problem solving, quality improvement, progressive enhancement  
**Example:** Code generation → Testing → Fixes → Repeat until tests pass

### LangGraph Agents

**When to use:** Complex workflows with conditional branching, dynamic routing, or state-dependent decisions  
**Perfect for:** Advanced orchestration, decision trees, adaptive workflows, multi-path processing  
**Example:** Customer support routing → Escalation logic → Specialized handlers based on issue type

<Callout type="info" title="Pro Tip: Combine Workflow Types">
  You can nest workflow agents! Create a sequential pipeline where one step is a
  parallel workflow, or use loops within larger sequential processes. This gives
  you powerful composition capabilities.
</Callout>

## Common Patterns

**Content Creation Pipeline**  
Sequential: Research → Write → Edit → Fact-check → Publish

**Multi-Source Analysis**  
Parallel: Process documents simultaneously → Aggregate insights

**Iterative Problem Solving**  
Loop: Generate solution → Test → Refine → Repeat until satisfactory

**Quality Assurance**  
Sequential + Parallel: Parallel checks (grammar, facts, style) → Sequential approval workflow

**Dynamic Decision Making**  
LangGraph: Customer inquiry → Route by type → Specialized handlers → Escalation logic → Resolution
