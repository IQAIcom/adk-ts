## What is ADK for TypeScript?

Agent Development Kit (ADK) for TypeScript is a powerful, open-source framework for **building, orchestrating, and deploying AI agents**.

Inspired by the architectural principles of Google's Python ADK, our project is reimagined for the TypeScript ecosystem. We offer first-class support for Google Gemini models while providing the freedom to **integrate with any LLM, tool, or data source**. ADK makes it easy to start with simple agents and scales to support complex, multi-agent systems in any Node.js environment.

## Why ADK for TypeScript?

Our vision is to empower every developer to build intelligent agents with the same confidence as any modern software. We achieve this through three core pillars:

-   **Unparalleled Developer Experience:** We are TypeScript-first, providing full type-safety and autocompletion out of the box. Our intuitive `AgentBuilder` API lets you create powerful agents with minimal, readable code.
-   **Powerful & Flexible Architecture:** ADK is modular by design. Compose multiple agents, equip them with custom tools, and orchestrate complex workflows. Our provider-agnostic foundation means you're never locked into a single ecosystem.
-   **Production-Ready from Day One:** Go beyond prototypes. With built-in session management, persistent memory, and first-class OpenTelemetry support for observability, ADK provides the robust foundation needed for real-world applications.

## Design Philosophy

ADK is designed with the following principles:

-   **TypeScript-first:** Full type safety and a modern developer experience.
-   **Simple APIs:** Common patterns should be one-liners.
-   **Gradual Complexity:** Start simple and add power as you need it.
-   **Extensibility:** Every core component is designed to be replaced or extended.
-   **Production Ready:** Built-in observability, error handling, and scalability.
-   **Excellent Google Integration:** While provider-agnostic, we ensure seamless support for Gemini models and Google Cloud services.
