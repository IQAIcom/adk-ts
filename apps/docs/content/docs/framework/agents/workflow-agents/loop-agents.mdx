Loop agents repeatedly execute a sub-agent until a stopping condition is met, enabling iterative improvement and progressive refinement workflows.

## Quick Example

Here's how to create a problem-solving loop that tries different approaches until finding a working solution:

```typescript
// Create a problem-solving agent
const solverAgent = new LlmAgent({
  name: "code-problem-solver",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  tools: [new CodeExecutorTool(), new ExitLoopTool()],
  instruction: `
    Try to solve the given coding problem step by step.
    Test your solution with the CodeExecutorTool.
    If tests pass, use ExitLoopTool to indicate success.
    If tests fail, analyze the error and try a different approach.
  `,
});

// Create loop agent that tries up to 8 different approaches
const { runner } = await AgentBuilder
  .create("persistent-solver")
  .withDescription("Keeps trying different approaches until finding a working solution")
  .asLoop([solverAgent], 8)
  .build();

// The loop will keep trying until solution works or max attempts reached
const result = await runner.ask(`
  Solve this problem:
  Write a function that finds the two numbers in an array that sum to a target value.

  Example: [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
  Should return indices [0, 1] because 2 + 7 = 9

  Test cases:
  - [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9 → [0, 1]
  - [3, 2, 4], target = 6 → [1, 2]
  - [3, 3], target = 6 → [0, 1]
`);
```

## Key Benefits

- **Iterative Improvement**: Each cycle builds on previous results for progressive refinement
- **Automatic Retry**: Keep trying until success or limits are reached
- **Quality Convergence**: Gradually approach desired quality standards
- **Flexible Stopping**: Multiple ways to determine when to stop

## When to Use

<Callout type="info" title="Convergence Required">
Use loop agents when you expect the process to converge toward a solution or when you have clear stopping criteria.
</Callout>

**Ideal for:**
- Content refinement (improve writing until quality standards are met)
- Problem solving (try different approaches until solution found)
- Research deepening (iterate to build comprehensive understanding)
- Code optimization (refine until performance goals achieved)

**Avoid when:**
- Single execution is sufficient
- No clear improvement path exists
- Infinite loops are possible without proper stopping conditions


<Callout type="warn" title="Loop Safety">
Always set reasonable maximum iteration limits to prevent infinite loops and monitor resource usage during extended execution.
</Callout>
