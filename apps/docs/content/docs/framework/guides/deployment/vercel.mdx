Vercel is a serverless platform optimized for frontend frameworks and API routes. **Best for**: API-based agents, webhook handlers, and request-response workflows with automatic scaling. Vercel offers zero-configuration deployment and automatic scaling, though it is limited by serverless function execution times. This guide shows you how to deploy your ADK-TS agent to Vercel.

## What You'll Need

Before deploying to Railway, ensure you have:

- A **[Vercel Account](https://vercel.com)** to manage your deployments
- Your **ADK-TS project** ready for deployment

## Deployment Options

Vercel offers two main deployment methods:

1. **GitHub Auto-Deploy**: Vercel automatically detects and builds your project from GitHub (Recommended)
2. **Vercel CLI**: Deploy directly from your terminal for manual control and testing

## Option 1: GitHub Auto-Deploy (Recommended)

Vercel automatically detects and builds your Node.js/TypeScript project without requiring manual configuration.

### Step 1: Push to GitHub

Commit and push your code to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Vercel deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Connect to Vercel

1. Log in to [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
2. Click **"Add New..."** → **"Project"**
3. Select **"Import Git Repository"** and choose your repository
4. Authorize Vercel to access your Git provider (if first time)
5. Choose the branch to deploy (usually `main`) and click **"Deploy"**

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

See [Configuring Environment Variables](#configuring-environment-variables) below for detailed instructions.

### Step 4: Automatic Deployment

Vercel handles everything automatically:

- First deployment: Clones your repo, installs dependencies, builds, and deploys
- Future updates: Every time you push to your connected branch, Vercel rebuilds and redeploys
- No manual steps needed after initial setup

## Option 2: Vercel CLI (Manual Deploy)

Use the Vercel CLI for manual deployments or when you want to deploy without a Git integration.

### Step 1: Install Vercel CLI

```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

### Step 2: Login

```bash
vercel login
```

### Step 3: Deploy

From your project directory:

```bash
# Deploy to preview (staging)
vercel

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

See [Configuring Environment Variables](#configuring-environment-variables) below.

## Configuring Environment Variables

All deployment options require environment variables to be configured in Vercel. This is a one-time setup for each project.

### Add Environment Variables to Vercel

1. In your Vercel project, go to **"Settings"** → **"Environment Variables"**
2. Add each required environment variable based on your agent's needs.

<Callout type="info" title="Environment Variables Are Encrypted">
  Vercel automatically encrypts all environment variables. Never commit these
  values to your git repository.
</Callout>

## Verifying Deployment

### Check Deployment Status

In your Vercel project dashboard:

1. Look for the **"Deployments"** tab - it should show "Ready" with a green indicator
2. Click on the latest deployment to view detailed logs and the deployment URL
3. Check the logs for your agent's startup messages
4. Look for any error messages

### Test Your Agent

Once deployment is active, test that it works:

- **API agents**: Make a test HTTP request to your endpoint (e.g., `https://your-project.vercel.app/api/chat`)
- **Check logs**: Watch Vercel logs in real-time to see your agent responding
- **Webhooks**: Verify that your webhook handlers are receiving data

## Monitoring and Updates

### View Logs

Vercel provides real-time logs in the **"Logs"** tab of your deployment. Use them to:

- Debug issues by viewing error messages
- Monitor your agent's activity and responses
- Track performance and execution times

### Updating Your Deployment

**For GitHub deployments (Option 1):**

1. Make code changes locally
2. Test changes locally using `vercel dev`
3. Commit and push to your connected branch:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update agent features"
   git push origin main
   ```
4. Vercel automatically detects changes, rebuilds, and redeploys

**For CLI deployments (Option 2):**

1. Make code changes locally
2. Deploy again using the CLI:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```
3. Vercel will create a new deployment automatically

## Vercel Troubleshooting

### Missing Environment Variables

**Problem**: Agent crashes or features don't work

- Go to Vercel's **"Environment Variables"** tab and verify all variables are present
- Check that variable names match exactly what your code expects (case-sensitive)
- Look for typos in variable values
- Trigger a new deployment after updating variables

### Build Failures

**Problem**: Vercel build fails

- Click on the failed deployment to view detailed build logs
- Look for error messages about missing dependencies or syntax errors
- Ensure all dependencies are listed in `package.json`
- Check for TypeScript compilation errors in the logs

### Function Timeouts

**Problem**: Agent execution exceeds Vercel's serverless timeout

- Increase `maxDuration` in your function configuration (up to your plan limit)
- Optimize your agent's processing time
- For long-running agents, consider using [Railway](/docs/framework/guides/deployment/railway) instead

### Deployment Conflicts

**Problem**: Multiple deployments triggering at once

- Check the **"Deployments"** tab to see which one is active
- Cancel unnecessary deployments if they are stuck
- Ensure your Git branch configuration is correct

## Vercel Best Practices

### Version Control

- Use separate environments (Production, Preview) to test changes
- Always test locally with `vercel dev` before pushing

### Cost Management

- Monitor function execution counts in the dashboard
- Set up budget alerts if using a Pro plan
- Use Vercel's usage dashboard to track resource consumption

### Reliability

- Implement proper error handling in your serverless functions
- Use health check endpoints to monitor availability
- Regularly review logs to catch "Cold Start" or timeout issues

### Security

- Never commit environment variables or secrets to git
- Use Vercel's Environment Variables for all sensitive data
- Implement authentication for your API endpoints

## Next Steps

- Explore the [Railway deployment guide](/docs/framework/guides/deployment/railway) for long-running agents
- Review [Docker deployment](/docs/guides/deployment/docker) for containerized options
- Set up monitoring and alerting for your deployed agents
