Sequential agents create powerful pipelines where agents execute in a specific order, with each step building on the results of the previous one. Think assembly line for AI - each agent specializes in one part of the process, and the final result is the combined output of all steps working together.

Perfect for workflows where order matters: research before analysis, writing before editing, data collection before processing. Unlike [parallel agents](/docs/framework/agents/workflow-agents/parallel-agents) that run simultaneously, sequential agents guarantee execution order and enable sophisticated multi-step reasoning.

<Callout type="info" title="When Order Matters">
  Use sequential agents when each step depends on the previous one's output. The
  magic happens when agents pass enriched context down the pipeline, creating
  more sophisticated results than any single agent could achieve.
</Callout>

## Quick Start Example

Here's a market research pipeline that transforms a simple query into comprehensive business intelligence:

```typescript
import { LlmAgent, SequentialAgent, WebSearchTool } from "@iqai/adk";

// Step 1: Gather raw data
const researchAgent = new LlmAgent({
  name: "market-researcher",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  instruction: `
    Research the given company/topic thoroughly. Focus on:
    - Current market position and competitors
    - Recent news and developments
    - Financial performance and growth trends
  `,
  tools: [new WebSearchTool()],
});

// Step 2: Analyze the collected data
const analysisAgent = new LlmAgent({
  name: "business-analyst",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  instruction: `
    Analyze the research data from the previous step. Identify:
    - Key opportunities and threats
    - Market trends and patterns
    - Competitive advantages and weaknesses
    Provide data-driven insights with specific examples.
  `,
});

// Step 3: Create actionable recommendations
const strategistAgent = new LlmAgent({
  name: "business-strategist",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  instruction: `
    Based on the research and analysis, create strategic recommendations:
    - 3-5 specific, actionable strategies
    - Risk assessment for each recommendation
    - Timeline and resource requirements
    Format as an executive summary.
  `,
});

// Sequential pipeline: research → analyze → strategize
const marketIntelligencePipeline = new SequentialAgent({
  name: "market-intelligence-pipeline",
  description: "Comprehensive market analysis and strategy development",
  subAgents: [researchAgent, analysisAgent, strategistAgent],
});

// Use the pipeline
const result = await marketIntelligencePipeline.run({
  message:
    "Analyze Tesla's position in the EV market and suggest growth strategies",
});
```

## How Sequential Processing Works

Sequential agents create a data pipeline where information gets progressively enriched at each step:

**🔄 Execution Flow**

1. **Agent 1** receives the original input and processes it
2. **Agent 2** gets both the original input AND Agent 1's output
3. **Agent 3** receives original input + Agent 1's output + Agent 2's output
4. This continues for each agent in the sequence

**💡 Context Accumulation**  
Each agent sees the full conversation history, so later agents can reference and build upon earlier agents' work. This creates sophisticated reasoning chains that single agents can't achieve.

**🎯 Deterministic Order**  
Execution order is guaranteed - no race conditions or unpredictable results. Perfect for production workflows where consistency matters.

<Callout type="info" title="Data Flow Between Agents">
  Agents automatically share session state, so later agents can reference
  earlier results. Use descriptive output and clear instructions to help agents understand what information to pass forward.
</Callout>

## Real-World Use Cases

**📊 Business Intelligence Pipeline**  
Research → Analysis → Strategic Recommendations → Executive Summary

**📝 Content Creation Workflow**  
Draft → Fact-check → Edit → Style Review → Final Polish

**🔍 Technical Documentation**  
Code Analysis → Documentation Draft → Technical Review → User Testing → Publication

**⚖️ Legal Document Review**  
Initial Review → Compliance Check → Risk Assessment → Final Approval

**🧪 Scientific Analysis**  
Data Collection → Statistical Analysis → Peer Review → Conclusion Generation

## When to Choose Sequential Agents

<Callout type="success" title="Perfect For Sequential Processing">
  - **Use when:** Each step builds on the previous one's output
  - **Benefit:** Creates sophisticated reasoning chains impossible with single agents
</Callout>

### ✅ Choose Sequential When:

- **Dependencies matter** - Later steps need earlier results
- **Quality control** - Each stage validates and improves the work
- **Specialization** - Different expertise needed at each step
- **Compliance** - Regulated workflows requiring specific order
- **Complex reasoning** - Multi-step analysis and decision making

### ❌ Don't Use Sequential When:

- Tasks are completely independent
- Speed is more important than thoroughness
- You need real-time parallel processing
- Simple, single-step operations
