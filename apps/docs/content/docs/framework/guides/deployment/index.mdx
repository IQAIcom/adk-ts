## Docker Fundamentals

Railway can auto-deploy without Docker knowledge (using Nixpacks), but understanding Docker basics helps if you need custom configurations. Docker is required for self-hosted deployments.

### What is Docker?

Docker packages your ADK-TS agent with all its dependencies into a **container** - a lightweight, portable unit that runs consistently across any environment. This eliminates "works on my machine" problems.

**Key concepts:**

- **Image**: A blueprint containing your code, dependencies, and runtime. Built once, deployed anywhere.
- **Container**: A running instance of an image. Your agent executes inside this isolated environment.
- **Registry**: A storage service for Docker images (like DockerHub, GitHub Container Registry, or AWS ECR).

### Platform Architecture

Your local machine might use a different processor architecture than cloud servers:

- **ARM64**: Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2/M3/M4) and some modern servers
- **AMD64**: Most cloud providers (Railway, AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)

When deploying to cloud platforms, build specifically for AMD64:

```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t my-agent:latest .
```

<Callout type="info" title="Why This Matters">
  If you build on Apple Silicon without specifying `--platform linux/amd64`,
  your image won't run on most cloud servers. Always specify the platform for
  production builds.
</Callout>

### Container Registries

After building your image, push it to a registry so cloud platforms can access it:

**DockerHub** (Easiest for beginners)

- Free tier available
- Public and private repositories
- `docker.io/username/image:tag`

**GitHub Container Registry** (If you use GitHub)

- Integrated with GitHub repos
- Fine-grained access control
- `ghcr.io/username/image:tag`

**AWS ECR** (If you use AWS)

- Integrated with AWS services
- Regional deployment
- `aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/image:tag`

## Dockerfile Reference

Use this standard Dockerfile for ADK-TS agents. Both Railway and Docker deployments use this same configuration.

### Basic Dockerfile

Create a `Dockerfile` in your project root:

```dockerfile
# Use Node.js 20 Alpine as the base image (lightweight Linux distribution)
FROM node:20-alpine

# Enable pnpm package manager and set a specific version for consistency
RUN corepack enable && corepack prepare pnpm@9.12.0 --activate

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files first for better Docker layer caching
COPY package.json pnpm-lock.yaml ./

# Install dependencies using frozen lockfile for reproducible builds
RUN pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

# Copy TypeScript config and source code
COPY tsconfig.json ./
COPY src ./src

# Build the project
RUN pnpm build

# Set production environment
ENV NODE_ENV=production

# Define the command to run when the container starts
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

### Multi-Stage Dockerfile (Advanced)

For production deployments, use multi-stage builds to create smaller, more secure images:

```dockerfile
# Build stage - compiles TypeScript
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder

RUN corepack enable && corepack prepare pnpm@9.12.0 --activate
WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json pnpm-lock.yaml ./
RUN pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

COPY tsconfig.json ./
COPY src ./src
RUN pnpm build

# Production stage - runs the compiled code
FROM node:20-alpine

RUN corepack enable && corepack prepare pnpm@9.12.0 --activate
WORKDIR /app

# Only install production dependencies
COPY package.json pnpm-lock.yaml ./
RUN pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --prod

# Copy compiled code from build stage
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist

ENV NODE_ENV=production
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

**Benefits**: Smaller images (no dev dependencies), faster deployments, improved security.

### .dockerignore

Create a `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from your Docker build:

```
node_modules
dist
.git
.env
.env.*
*.log
.DS_Store
coverage
.vscode
.idea
README.md
.gitignore
```

This reduces image size and prevents accidentally including sensitive data.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying your agent, ensure you have:

- **Built and tested** your ADK-TS agent locally
- **Environment variables** documented and ready to configure
- **Dependencies** properly defined in `package.json`
- **Production configuration** prepared (API keys, database connections, etc.)

## General Best Practices

- **Environment Variables**: Never commit sensitive data; use platform-specific secret management
- **Health Checks**: Implement health check endpoints for monitoring
- **Logging**: Configure proper logging for production debugging
- **Error Handling**: Ensure graceful error handling and recovery
- **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate memory and CPU limits
- **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring and alerting for your deployed agents
