# 05 - Planning and Code Execution

Learn how to enhance agent reasoning with planning and code execution capabilities.

## Concepts Covered

- **Built-in planner** - Enhanced reasoning with thinking configuration
- **PlanReAct planner** - Multi-step problem decomposition
- **Code execution** - Running Python code dynamically
- **Data analysis** - Statistical computations and analysis
- **Algorithm implementation** - Dynamic algorithm creation and testing

## Running the Example

```bash
pnpm dev --name 05-planning-and-code-execution
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Planners** help agents break down complex problems
2. **Code execution** enables mathematical and data processing tasks
3. **PlanReAct** is ideal for multi-step projects
4. **Combining planning + code** creates powerful problem-solving agents
